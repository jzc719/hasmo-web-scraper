<h4>At a glance</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Labor markets in advanced economies today are among the tightest in two decades,</strong> not merely a pandemic-induced blip but rather a long-term trend that may continue as workforces age.</li>
    <li><strong>Tightness means forgone economic output.</strong> We estimate that GDP in 2023 could have been 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent higher across these economies if employers had been able to fill their excess job vacancies.</li>
    <li><strong>Companies and economies will need to boost productivity and find new ways to expand the workforce.</strong> Otherwise, they will struggle to exceed—or even match—the relatively muted economic growth of the past decade.</li>
    <li><strong>Actions for companies and policy makers include:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on skilling and reskilling, including attracting talent from unconventional pools, offering more flexible work, and internal mobility.</li>
        <li>Encourage foreign-born workers with programs to properly integrate them into the workforce.</li>
        <li>Shape retirement policies to encourage people to work beyond standard retirement ages and take steps to attract more women into the workforce, for example, by offering elder or childcare infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Prioritize investment in labor-complementing and labor-substituting AI and automation to unlock productivity.</li>
    </ul>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Labor market tightness</strong> is a persistent challenge. Though loosening somewhat since their 2022 peaks, labor markets in advanced economies remain tighter than at any other time over the past two decades. This is not a pandemic-induced phenomenon. Rather, it continues a long-term trend that started in 2010, when advanced economies began their protracted recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Shifting demographic forces could intensify this trend in the future. As workforces age and population growth decelerates, countries cannot count on excess workers to power economic growth. Absent concerted efforts to boost productivity or increases in the workforce through higher participation or immigration, many advanced economies will struggle to exceed—or even match—the relatively muted economic growth of the past decade.</p>
<p>So far, the impact of the labor market squeeze has been unevenly distributed. Job vacancies have climbed most steeply in sectors that traditionally have low productivity, such as healthcare and hospitality, as well as those with stagnant productivity, like construction. Without action, labor shortages may continue to hit sectors that struggle to increase productivity.</p>
<p>Tight job markets present both challenges and opportunities. Job seekers find work more easily and may garner higher wages. Yet upward wage pressure can spur inflation and stress businesses, particularly smaller ones. For instance, companies may need to turn down orders because they can’t hire enough workers to satisfy demand. At the economy level, we estimate that GDP in 2023 could have been 0.5 to 1.5 percent higher in the biggest advanced economies if employers had been able to fill their job vacancies.</p>
<p>Businesses large and small will need strategies to confront persistent labor shortages. Deploying and adopting technologies is one way they can power productivity growth. Retraining programs can help workers gain new skills needed as technologies shift, and matching programs can pair people with jobs. Businesses also can expand their hiring pools, including by seeking to attract immigrants and people who might otherwise sit on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, this article examines labor markets in advanced economies, using 20 charts to illustrate conditions in labor markets today, future prospects, and actions to address shortages. These labor markets range across 30 economies in Asia, Europe, and North America, with a particular focus on the eight largest: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>

<h2 id="tightness-trend">Tightness is the trend</h2>
<p>Today’s tight labor markets reflect longer-term trends in vacancy and unemployment rates across advanced economies.</p>
<p>Since 2010, labor markets have tightened across all 30 advanced economies we analyzed.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="a86bc5d5-ebf8-4977-b74e-a2e10fc86027"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="a86bc5d5-ebf8-4977-b74e-a2e10fc86027" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">The 30 countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</span></span></span></a></span> Comparing job vacancies with numbers of unemployed job seekers provides one measure of labor market tightness.

A line chart plots 30 lines, starting on the left with mostly low up-and-down volatility and rising upward to the right with higher volatility. Each line represents an advanced economy, and the 8 countries featured in the text are highlighted. The vertical axis shows the number of job vacancies per unemployed person, starting at 0 on the bottom and rising to 2.5. The horizontal axis shows years, from 2000 on the left to 2023 on the right. The lines stay below 1 on the vertical axis until about 2015, when many of the lines rise closer to 1, with 8 of them surpassing 1, including the US, Japan, and Germany. Annotations next to the graph note that in aggregate, the job vacancy rate rose by a multiple of 4.2, and the individual multiples for the 8 highlighted countries ranged from 2.3 to 6.7.

<p>Labor shortages have appeared across a diverse group of countries that have no apparent common features other than their stage of development. Tightness is particularly acute in seven countries—the Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, and the United States—that have more vacancies than unemployed workers. Together these countries account for 53 percent of the total labor supply of the 30 advanced economies in our research, and 64 percent of collective GDP. In another seven countries, the number of job vacancies is 0.5 to 1.0 times the number of unemployed workers. Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom are in this group.</p>
<p>But not all large economies have labor shortages. For example, labor markets in France and Italy remain relatively slack, as they do in 14 other countries among the 30. This group collectively accounts for 31 percent of total labor supply and 20 percent of total GDP. Yet even in most of these places, labor markets have tightened. Vacancies per unemployed person have increased by five times in Italy and by almost four times in France.</p>
<p>The tightening trend began after the 2008 financial crisis, when job vacancies were dwarfed by a vast number of unemployed people. The recovery was slow: labor markets in these 30 economies took 8.2 years on average to reach the degree of tightness they had before the crisis.</p>
<p>The desire to hire carried on apace, and labor markets continued to tighten until the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in early 2020. During the pandemic, many labor markets oscillated, first to extreme looseness and then to extreme tightness. Generous fiscal stimulus measures during the crisis fueled a comparatively fast job recovery, and by 2022, labor markets had achieved the highest ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people in two decades. Today, labor markets remain historically tight but have cooled somewhat from that peak. For instance, as of April 2024, the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio in the United States had dropped to 1.2 from 1.4 at the end of the prior year.</p>

These included the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Labor supply, or all the people seeking work, is the sum of the people with jobs (employed people) and people looking or recently looking for jobs (unemployed people).</li>
    <li>Labor demand, or all jobs that need workers, is the sum of filled positions (equal to employed people) and unfilled positions (vacancies or job openings).</li>
    <li>Unemployment rate, or the percentage of people seeking work who haven’t found jobs, is unemployed people divided by labor supply (the sum of employed and unemployed people).</li>
    <li>Vacancy rate, or the percentage of jobs that remain unfilled, is job vacancies divided by labor demand (the sum of filled jobs and job vacancies).</li>
</ul>
<p>We focus on measuring labor market tightness as the ratio of vacancy rates to unemployment rates, but our conclusions hold if we examine unemployment rates only (exhibit). In 2023 in all countries but Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden, the unemployment rate was lower than the median observed since 2000, and the average unemployment rate across 30 advanced economies was among the lowest one-fifth of unemployment rates observed since 2000.</p>

<p>To explore the micro underpinnings of labor shortages, we analyzed vacancy and employment data at the sector level in seven of the eight focus countries. (We were unable to extract the same data for Japan.) Additionally, we combined US occupational data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics with McKinsey Global Institute’s skills taxonomy to understand the types of jobs and workers most affected by the labor shortage.</p>
<p>We also tested whether labor market tightness was a result of mismatches between workers and available jobs. This happens when vacancy rates rise without a commensurate decline in unemployment rates or vice versa. While we found evidence of such mismatches in Australia, Canada, and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, by the end of 2022 they were resolving, and so that analysis is absent from this report.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="de93d1f5-5058-402e-aa94-4ca4ffd6d309"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="de93d1f5-5058-402e-aa94-4ca4ffd6d309" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">This can be seen on the Beveridge curve, which illustrates the relationship between unemployment rates and job opening rates.

<p>Across the eight focus economies, labor markets have retreated from peak tightness during the COVID-19 pandemic toward conditions more similar to the rising prepandemic trend. Only Italy, which had one of the loosest labor markets among developed economies before the pandemic, shows no signs of declining tightness yet. This could be the result of the Italian government’s fiscal response to COVID-19, which the International Monetary Fund estimates exceeded 45 percent of the country’s GDP, making it the most generous relief package among advanced economies.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="4e075726-6f36-4c83-9503-ffe62b7cc887"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="4e075726-6f36-4c83-9503-ffe62b7cc887" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Database of Fiscal Policy Responses to COVID-19, International Monetary Fund, accessed May 28, 2023.</span></span></span></a></span> Japan, where the labor market was among the tightest before the pandemic, lags its prepandemic trend, in part because a weakening yen increased costs in the import-dependent economy.

<p>Since 2010, countries that have increased GDP fastest have done so primarily by adding more workers rather than by improving productivity. In markets such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, where labor has been relatively plentiful and consequently easier to hire, companies had a business rationale to add hours and employment rather than tackling the harder job of improving productivity. Countries where labor wasn’t so plentiful—Germany and Japan, for example—relied more on productivity growth to propel their economies, although that did not fully compensate for low labor force growth. In fact, labor productivity has stagnated in many advanced economies, as documented in previous McKinsey Global Institute reports.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="73ca9760-fb34-477c-aa78-8e44a47716ec"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="73ca9760-fb34-477c-aa78-8e44a47716ec" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">For more, see <em><a href="/mgi/our-research/investing-in-productivity-growth">Investing in productivity growth</a></em>, McKinsey Global Institute, March 2024, and <em><a href="/mgi/our-research/rekindling-us-productivity-for-a-new-era">Rekindling US productivity for a new era</a></em>, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2023.</span></span></span></a></span></p>

In 2010, there were roughly 24 million excess workers, as measured by comparing the number of job seekers with the number of job openings across the eight countries. Today the number of job seekers is close to the number of job vacancies.</p>
<p>However, the degree of excess supply (or no excess supply at all, in some cases) varies at the country level. Labor demand exceeded supply in Germany, Japan, and the United States at the end of 2023. Recently, Germany enacted a law aimed at increasing immigration of highly skilled workers, and in the United States efforts are under way to establish a federal commission to study labor shortages and find ways to address them.</p>
<p>The excess supply of unemployed workers relative to job openings in France and Italy was two million and one million, respectively. While these economies have meaningful slack in their labor markets today, even they have tightened. Their excess labor figures are 7.1 and 5.7 percent, respectively, down from prepandemic peaks well above 10 percent.</p>
<p>The factors that drove labor market tightness also varied across countries. Unemployment rates in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States came down from highs in 2010, while Australia never had very high unemployment. Italy continued to have a relatively high rate of unemployment but also increased vacancies, suggesting either a mismatch or a higher natural rate of unemployment. Meanwhile, demand increased markedly in Japan while its shrinking population constrained its labor supply.</p></div></div></div><div class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-media__i1e6z StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-8"><div class=""><picture data-component="mdc-c-picture" class="Exhibit_mck-c-exhibit__image__keB_s"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-laborshortage-ex5-excess-supply-vf.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center"/><img alt="The excess supply of labor has dwindled." src="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-laborshortage-ex5-excess-supply-vf.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><div class="mck-u-sr-only"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-component="mdc-c-module-wrapper" data-module-theme="light" data-module-background="white" data-module-category="" class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__item__R_JmA"><div class="mck-o-container"><div class="mck-o-container--wrapped mck-o-container--mobile-spacing mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-col-md-12 StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-item__daFsw"><div data-component="mdc-c-content-block" class="mdc-c-content-block___7p6Lu_d0bf44e mdc-u-grid-gutter-md StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-text__2zRUu StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-4"><h2 data-component="mdc-c-heading" class="mdc-c-heading___0fM1W_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-5"><div>The labor surplus has fallen from 24 million to 1 million since 2010 in eight advanced economies</div></h2><div data-component="mdc-c-description" class="mdc-c-description___SrnQP_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-8 mck-u-links-inline"><div><p>The number of excess workers dwindled as growth in labor demand outpaced growth in labor supply. Labor forces in these eight countries grew between 2010 and 2023. Propelled by population growth and increased labor force participation that outweighed the impact of aging, 33 million workers in total joined their labor forces.</p>
<p>Over the same period, labor demand grew strongly, fueled by expansive monetary and fiscal policies as these countries recovered from the financial crisis. Employers needed to fill some 57 million additional jobs over the same period, or 24 million more than the number of available workers. Most advanced economies avoided subsequent downturns. This uninterrupted growth in demand not only drove average unemployment down from 8 percent to 4 percent but also created an additional ten million unfilled jobs across the eight economies.</p>
<p>During that time, people worked fewer hours on average, but the imbalance between job seekers and available jobs wasn’t due to that change. From 2010 to 2023, the average number of hours worked per employee fell from 37 to 36, a 3 percent decline roughly equivalent to just 33,000 workers in 2023. Declining working hours affect labor supply and labor demand equally, meaning the net effect is negligible.</p>
<p>Countries today have fewer than one million excess workers in aggregate: the number of job seekers is close to the number of job vacancies. What appears to be a perfectly matched labor market is in reality an extremely tight one, since some degree of excess supply is always the norm—matching is never perfect, and demand and supply are always in flux as workers switch jobs and employers shift strategies.</p></div></div></div><div class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-media__i1e6z StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-8"></div></div></div></div><div data-component="mdc-c-module-wrapper" data-module-theme="light" data-module-background="white" data-module-category="" class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__item__R_JmA"><div class="mck-o-container"><div class="mck-o-container--wrapped mck-o-container--mobile-spacing mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-col-md-12 StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-item__daFsw"><div data-component="mdc-c-content-block" class="mdc-c-content-block___7p6Lu_d0bf44e mdc-u-grid-gutter-md StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-text__2zRUu StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-4"><h2 data-component="mdc-c-heading" class="mdc-c-heading___0fM1W_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-5"><div>GDP could have been higher by 0.5 to 1.5 percent in 2023 if excess vacancies had been fewer</div></h2><div data-component="mdc-c-description" class="mdc-c-description___SrnQP_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-8 mck-u-links-inline"><div><p>Increased job vacancies can constrain real economic output; they represent demand for goods and services that businesses are unable to fulfill.

<p>We estimate the additional output that would have been produced if labor markets were not so tight by examining the degree to which vacancy rates are higher than a structural or natural rate of vacancies. Structural vacancy rates vary across industries and countries and can even vary over time. To account for this, we compared sector-level vacancy rates in 2023 to vacancy rates in 2019 as well as to the median rate from 2010 to 2019. We find that, depending on the country, GDP could have been 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent higher in 2023 if that unmet labor demand had been filled.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="13f7286d-060c-44e8-9d3f-6b6ac604e9ab"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="13f7286d-060c-44e8-9d3f-6b6ac604e9ab" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">To estimate how much GDP might have been generated absent increased labor market tightness, we determined how many additional workers would be employed if 2023 job vacancy rates by sector fell to their historical level in 2019, or to their median vacancy rate level from 2010 to 2019, in each country. The output was estimated based on that number of workers and the average productivity per worker, at 2023 levels, for each sector.

<p>Labor shortages have had the biggest impact on labor-hungry sectors, such as healthcare and construction, as previously noted. Demand for labor has risen faster than the sector’s ability to attract workers. Vacancies have increased in public and private healthcare systems despite efforts in countries such as the United Kingdom to attract immigrants to the sector, and construction is booming in most advanced economies due to housing shortages and infrastructure needs. Typically less capital intensive and more difficult to automate, these sectors added jobs at or faster than the average clip but not fast enough to keep pace with demand. In Canada, for instance, a recent House of Commons committee report acknowledged that the country has “longstanding issues with lack of supply of health professionals,” in part due to mental health issues and burnout exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which have led to retention issues.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="2fa28320-3368-4c7c-ab2c-a1ea571459b0"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="2fa28320-3368-4c7c-ab2c-a1ea571459b0" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Sean Casey,<em> Addressing Canada’s healthcare workforce crisis</em>, Report of the Standing Committee on Health, House of Commons, Canada, March 2023.</span></span></span></a></span>  And some Italian construction companies are turning to workforce development programs and partnerships with African universities to recruit and train new workers.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="0b8e6528-32e7-413b-9576-6c7f0faf9221"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="0b8e6528-32e7-413b-9576-6c7f0faf9221" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">“Webuild CEO Pietro Salini: Ready to hire about 10,000 people in next three years to develop infrastructure in Italy,” Webuild Group, September 18, 2023.</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p>Conversely, labor-attracting sectors like financial and real estate, information, and professional services have also added employment faster than average—they have attracted workers at a faster pace than their demand for labor has grown. In this group, only the professional services sector increased its share of overall vacancies.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is a labor-disrupting sector. Although the sector accounted for a smaller part of the workforce in 2023 than in 2010 across the eight countries, its job vacancies nonetheless increased significantly, especially after 2019. Research by economist Richard Baldwin found that since 2013, the manufacturing sector has lost 20 million jobs globally due to productivity gains from increasing automation.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="6e050e6a-ea3f-4a95-aa59-46bc6eb94427"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">3</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="6e050e6a-ea3f-4a95-aa59-46bc6eb94427" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Richard Baldwin, “Where in the world are manufacturing jobs going?” Factful Friday with Richard Baldwin, LinkedIn, December 22, 2023.</span></span></span></a></span> The mix of workforce skills has been changing, as some manufacturing jobs require more customer relations or analytics, and as corporate manufacturing footprints are themselves changing. For example, areas such as semiconductors and electric vehicle manufacturing are demanding more workers as a result of shifts in industrial policy and “friendshoring.”</p>
<p>Trade is a labor-efficient sector, in which productivity enhancements have eased the pressure to hire. As consumer demand has shifted, the retail segment of the trade sector has increasingly automated and digitized, increasing productivity and mitigating the impact of labor shortages. In Japan, for example, convenience stores are responding to staff shortages not only by relying on immigrant labor but also by rolling out technology like self-checkout and cleaning robots.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="f7b1b4e2-0200-4218-9c8d-ab8d4f0cb11e"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">4</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="f7b1b4e2-0200-4218-9c8d-ab8d4f0cb11e" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">For immigrant labor, see “For a glimpse of Japan’s future, see its convenience stores,” <em>Economist</em>, April 4, 2024.

<p>Opportunities exist to boost productivity across sectors. The leisure and hospitality sector in the United States provides a case study. In 2021, the sector accounted for 16 percent of all job vacancies, a comparatively big share that was three percentage points higher than its average from 2010 to 2020. The sector responded to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by automating more processes and raising wages by an average of 29 percent from mid-2019 to mid-2023. Those steps increased the sector’s productivity by 6.4 percent over that period, decreasing pressure to hire and reducing its share of vacancies as its vacancy rate fell to 6 percent in 2023 from a decade high of 11 percent in 2021.</p></div></div></div><div class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-media__i1e6z StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-8"><div class=""><picture data-component="mdc-c-picture" class="Exhibit_mck-c-exhibit__image__keB_s"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-helpwanted-ex10-sector-productivity-growth-vs-output.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center"/><img alt="Sectors struggling with productivity contributed disproportionately to vacancy growth" src="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-helpwanted-ex10-sector-productivity-growth-vs-output.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><div class="mck-u-sr-only">Image description:

The changing skill mix <em>within</em> occupations has already shown up in the United Kingdom in increased references to the need for technological skills in occupational postings.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="2a5add72-21b3-482f-aba4-94f6e43b3387"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="2a5add72-21b3-482f-aba4-94f6e43b3387" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Rui Costa et al., “Old skills, new skills—what is changing in the UK labour market” <em>The Pissarides Review into the Future of Work and Wellbeing</em>, Institute for the Future of Work, February 2024.</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p>However, a shortage of physical and manual skills has likely exacerbated recent labor market tightness. Jobs requiring these skills had the lowest vacancy rate among the five broad skill categories, and job vacancies seeking these skills increased most since 2015. This reflects growing demand for manufacturing and repair workers as well as for some types of healthcare workers, like nursing assistants. For instance, Delaware has begun offering tuition assistance and other incentives to attract workers to study nursing in an effort to address a shortage of trained nurses.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="75f34347-1161-4446-9707-cd7acd333f19"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">3</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="75f34347-1161-4446-9707-cd7acd333f19" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">See Johnny Perez-Gonzalez, “Delaware responds to nursing shortage with ‘Tuition Incentive Program,’” WHYY, December 13, 2023.</span></span></span></a></span></p></div></div></div><div class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-media__i1e6z StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-8"><div class=""><div class="flourish-chart flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/17507244?946647?956372"></div></div><div class="mck-u-sr-only"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-component="mdc-c-module-wrapper" data-module-theme="light" data-module-background="lightest-grey" data-module-category="" class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__item__R_JmA"><div class="mck-o-container"><div class="mck-o-container--wrapped mck-o-container--mobile-spacing mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-col-md-12 StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-item__daFsw"><div data-component="mdc-c-content-block" class="mdc-c-content-block___7p6Lu_d0bf44e mdc-u-grid-gutter-md StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-text__2zRUu StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-4"><div data-component="mdc-c-description" class="mdc-c-description___SrnQP_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-8 mck-u-links-inline"><div><p>The occupations with the biggest increase in share of vacancies are associated with labor-hungry sectors such as food service, healthcare, and construction.

A horizontal bar chart is organized in 22 rows from highest to lowest value, with two thirds of the bars having positive values extending to the right, and the rest at the bottom with negative values extending to the left. The chart plots the percentage point change in job vacancy share by occupational group. At the top increasing by 1.1 to 2.1 points are food preparation and serving related occupations; installation, maintenance, and repair occupations; and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations. At the bottom decreasing by 1.5 to 3.7 points are computer and mathematical occupations; sales and related occupations; and business and financial operations occupations. Next to the first chart is a horizontal stacked bar chart with an arrow connecting it to the top three bars from the first chart, plotting the distribution of the 5 occupational skills associated with those occupations, which represent a quarter of the US workforce. Physical and manual skills are the largest segment at 66%, indicating that those skills are prevalent in occupations with the largest increase in job vacancy share. Another horizontal stacked bar chart connects to the bars at the bottom of the first chart, representing another quarter of the workforce. Physical and manual skills are the smallest segment at 5%, indicating that those skills are not prevalent in occupations with the greatest decrease in job vacancy share.

From 2010 to 2023, 34 million additional people joined the workforces across the eight countries, an average growth rate of 0.6 percent a year. The first factor influencing this growth is the expansion of population, both from so-called natural growth, or the net of new births and deaths, and from immigration. The second factor is linked to an aging mix of workers and had the opposite impact, pushing supply lower. The third factor is increased participation in the labor force, which helps mitigate the impact of aging.</p>
<p>The independent contribution of each of these three factors is clear. Had population alone grown, it would have accounted for 31 million of the 34 million added workers. Aging alone would have led to 18 million<em> fewer </em>workers as more seniors dropped out of the labor force. However, at the same time, labor force participation has increased, particularly among workers 55 years and older. The combined effects of these three factors net to 34 million additional workers.</p>
<p>The dynamics of these three factors varied greatly by country. Labor supply grew fastest in Australia and Canada, driven by strong population growth. Population growth also drove increased labor supply in the United Kingdom and the United States, though more moderately than in Australia and Canada. Germany’s labor supply growth was due largely to increased participation rates, while France’s growth came from both population growth and more participation. In Japan and Italy, the impact of aging has been much more pronounced than in other countries, although for now increased participation has allowed for continued modest labor force growth.</p></div></div></div><div class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-media__i1e6z StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-8"><div class=""><picture data-component="mdc-c-picture" class="Exhibit_mck-c-exhibit__image__keB_s"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-helpwanted-ex14-labor-force-growth-factors.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center"/><img alt="Higher participation rates mitigated the impact of aging on labor supply" src="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-helpwanted-ex14-labor-force-growth-factors.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><div class="mck-u-sr-only">Image description:

In fact, populations in Japan and Italy are shrinking, and, according to United Nations estimates, the German population will begin to shrink by 2030.</p>
<p>Falling birth rates in many advanced economies largely explain their slower population growth. In some countries, immigration has also declined, exacerbating the trend. Immigration could have compensated for natural population decline, or when deaths exceed births, since 2015—if it had been roughly 1.5 to 3.0 times higher than current levels in Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In France, Italy, and Japan, it would have needed to be even higher.</p>
<p>Immigration enables short-term labor supply growth. By contrast, it takes perhaps 20 years for natural increase in a population to affect the labor market, because a baby born today cannot meaningfully work for roughly 20 years. Many immigrants are of working age and so can participate in the labor force today.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="b2a60b97-b30b-4869-80e9-938ca1bf7811"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="b2a60b97-b30b-4869-80e9-938ca1bf7811" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">“Foreign-born workers: Labor force characteristics—2023,” US Bureau of Labor Statistics press release, May 21, 2024.</span></span></span></a></span> For instance, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the US labor force in 2033 will be larger by 5.2 million people, mostly because of higher net immigration.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="25d4884c-28a6-4c0b-869c-e73470d6f6c5"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="25d4884c-28a6-4c0b-869c-e73470d6f6c5" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Phillip L.

Eight sets of vertical stacked bar charts, 1 for each of the highlighted countries, plot the share of the age 15-plus population that is 55 years and older in three different years: 2010, 2023, and a UN projection for 2030. The bars increase in height across each chart, with 2030 totals ranging from 37% in Australia to 52% in Japan. The bar segments split the totals into two age groups: 55&ndash;64 and 65-plus, with the 65-plus segments accounting for more than half of the height of nearly all of the bars.

We compared the ratio of female and male labor force participation rates and average hours worked per week to approximate the gender gap in the workforces of our focus countries. We found the gender gap has been shrinking since 2010, more significantly in labor force participation than in hours. About 60 percent of the workers who joined the labor force from 2010 to 2023 were women. In Italy, Japan, and Germany, the narrowing gender gap is due entirely to women participating in the labor force more. In other countries, the ratio climbed as women increased their labor force participation while participation among men declined, by as much as three percentage points in some places.</p>
<p>Currently more women work part-time than men, likely due to different responsibilities in the household. Improving labor force participation among women may therefore be encouraged by flexible working arrangements and access to care support. For example, Japan has made progress on its gender gap in part through a set of policies called Womenomics that include providing daycare support and tax incentives to encourage married women to join the labor market.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="ff8e7d4f-8fad-4b92-885a-044be2c22857"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="ff8e7d4f-8fad-4b92-885a-044be2c22857" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">“Japan introduces ‘womenomics’ to counter the country’s aging workforce and boost GDP,” Council on Foreign Relations, accessed May 20, 2024.</span></span></span></a></span> Such interventions could increase the contribution of women to labor supply growth and reduce tightness in the labor market.</p></div></div></div><div class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-media__i1e6z StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-8"><div class=""><div class="flourish-chart flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/17946187?946647?956372"></div></div><div class="mck-u-sr-only"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-component="mdc-c-module-wrapper" data-module-theme="light" data-module-background="white" data-module-category="" class="StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__item__R_JmA"><div class="mck-o-container"><div class="mck-o-container--wrapped mck-o-container--mobile-spacing mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-col-md-12 StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-item__daFsw"><div data-component="mdc-c-content-block" class="mdc-c-content-block___7p6Lu_d0bf44e mdc-u-grid-gutter-md StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__content-text__2zRUu StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky__fPTBk StoryContainer_mck-c-story-container__container-sticky--extra-spacing___xzed mdc-u-grid-col-md-span-4"><h2 data-component="mdc-c-heading" class="mdc-c-heading___0fM1W_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-5"><div>Labor supply growth is expected to slow further</div></h2><div data-component="mdc-c-description" class="mdc-c-description___SrnQP_d0bf44e mdc-u-ts-8 mck-u-links-inline"><div><p>Looking ahead, we examined two possible scenarios for labor force participation rates in 2030.

The United States has so far navigated an economic soft landing, but any economic downturn could crimp job demand. Meanwhile, Germany and Japan have experienced only tepid demand growth, calling into question the underlying strength of demand in those countries.</p>
<p>By contrast, new technologies offer the potential for more robust productivity growth that could dispel some of those concerns. Our two productivity growth scenarios include a higher estimate that uses average productivity growth from 1999 to 2007, a period of robust productivity growth before the financial crisis, and a lower estimate that uses productivity growth from 2012 to 2022.

For economies to maintain stability or grow, they will need to go beyond business as usual to boost productivity or find additional workers in new ways.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="DefaultScrolly_mck-c-default-scrolly__scrolly-media-content__V0YUi" data-module-background="white" data-module-theme="light"><div class="DefaultScrolly_mck-c-default-scrolly__container-sticky__qw5Xo"><div class="media-container-AA88C44B23A241E0A384599DEA5FBB2A DefaultScrolly_mck-c-default-scrolly__media-container__2wk69"><div class="DefaultScrolly_mck-c-default-scrolly__media__O5f_x DefaultScrolly_mck-c-default-scrolly__media--visible__9WZwS mck-u-animation-fade-in"><picture data-component="mdc-c-picture"><img alt="To maintain GDP growth, all countries need additional labor supply or productivity growth—and some need both (1 or 6)" src="/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/help%20wanted%20charting%20the%20challenge%20of%20tight%20labor%20markets%20in%20advanced%20economies/mgi-helpwanted-ex20a-gdp-growth-scenarios.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center" loading="eager"/></picture><div class="mck-u-sr-only">Image description:
The first of 6 panels shows 8 vertical bar charts, 1 for each of the highlighted countries. Each chart has 4 bars, mostly increasing in height from left to right, representing different scenarios for GDP growth over 2023&ndash;30. The vertical axis is an index going from &ndash;150 at the bottom to 325 at the top, with a 100 value representing the country&rsquo;s 2012&ndash;22 average. The first bar on the left is the lowest, representing a scenario in which the labor participation rate remains stable and productivity growth follows the current trend. The second bar is the next tallest for most countries, representing a scenario in which labor participation grows. The third bar is next tallest for most countries, going back to a scenario with stable labor participation but with productivity growth following the pre-2007 trend. The fourth bar is the tallest for all countries, representing a scenario of growing labor participation and pre-2007 productivity.

<h2>Concerted actions can improve labor supply and productivity and better match people to jobs.</h2>
<p>All labor market stakeholders—employers, market influencers, policy makers, training institutions, and other workforce development organizations—can address labor shortages. Each can act by improving supply, productivity, or matching. Action employers can take include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Improve their value proposition for prospective talent and talent they already employ.</em> Prior McKinsey research has found that some of the most sought-after talent values flexibility and meaningful work.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="28122002-f440-4ddd-a013-eb8aa36d0859"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">3</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="28122002-f440-4ddd-a013-eb8aa36d0859" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Aaron De Smet, Bonnie Dowling, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, and Bill Schaninger, “‘<a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/great-attrition-or-great-attraction-the-choice-is-yours">Great attrition’ or ‘great attraction’? The choice is yours</a>,” <em>McKinsey Quarterly</em>, September 8, 2021.</span></span></span></a></span> Providing flexibility, like hybrid working arrangements or flexible hours, and evaluating performance based on output rather than hours worked allow top talent to create more sustainability in work. Training and career advancement opportunities could attract workers to hard-to-fill occupations typically plagued by vacancies. Indeed, companies that excel at training and internal mobility achieve better talent retention as well as top-tier financial performance and more consistent and resilient performance.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined FootNote_inactive__gEMzO" aria-describedby="1390e592-71d0-45b2-a179-9717ece1be9d"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">4</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="1390e592-71d0-45b2-a179-9717ece1be9d" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">See <em><a href="/mgi/our-research/performance-through-people-transforming-human-capital-into-competitive-advantage">Performance through people: Transforming human capital into competitive advantage</a></em>, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2023.</span></span></span></a></span> Companies can also double down on retaining talent they already have by, say, improving internal social connections and investing in and developing high-quality managers.</li>
    <li><em>Seek talent outside traditional hiring pools.</em> Companies should seek talent in broader, more unconventional pools, including by shifting from credentials-based to skills-based hiring. They can offer more flexible work arrangements for parents and seniors contemplating retirement. Employers could also consider looking at often-overlooked groups, like recently incarcerated workers and those with gaps in their résumés, as potential sources of untapped talent.</li>
    <li><em>Unlock talent in their own organizations through internal mobility. </em>Employers can address skill mismatches by actively shaping career pathways to help employees acquire new skills and by making mobility and rotation a vital part of company strategy. Fostering a culture of collaboration is essential to helping employees discover and build cross-functional skills, with the triple benefits of improved innovation, fewer skill gaps, and higher employee retention.</li>
    <li><em>Invest in labor-complementing and labor-substituting technology and operations to unlock productivity.</em> Technology adoption can take center stage on company agendas in a tight labor environment, including a full assessment of the potential for augmentation and automation with artificial intelligence and other technologies at the level of specific occupations and work processes. Occupations in administrative support or food services, for instance, have high potential for automation, while healthcare and management occupations have little potential. Companies can then develop short- and long-term strategies to deploy technology and other process improvements to improve the efficiency and attractiveness of jobs that can be enhanced with automation. To capture the full productivity benefit of new technologies, companies also can invest in reskilling, for example through on-the-job training and coaching, creating centers of excellence to better harness skills within their workforces, and identifying skill gaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Policy makers and other market-making participants can take the following steps to address tight markets:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Make it easier for older workers, women, and foreign-born talent to find work.</em> To increase labor force participation among older workers, policy makers can implement more flexible retirement policies that encourage workers to continue working beyond standard retirement ages. They also can design policies to support working parents, such as establishing a minimum leave and improving access to childcare, two policies that have improved female participation in some countries. The supply of workers outside of the developed world remains large, but foreign-born workers can be an immediate and significant source of labor only if properly integrated into the workforce.</li>
    <li><em>Support the building of human capital across the workforce.</em> Scaling up reskilling programs and improving access to and the capacity of career-oriented schools will help improve the human capital of the workforce. Policy makers can develop incentives to support retraining and other programs needed to facilitate occupational transitions that often accompany continued technological improvement. This approach could be accelerated by artificial intelligence in some countries.</li>
    <li><em>Reduce labor market barriers to help match job seekers to job openings.</em> Discouraging barriers to employment, like credentialing and noncompete agreements, as well as improving housing affordability in high-productivity, job-rich regions would allow talent to migrate to where it is most needed and most valuable. Universities and workforce development programs can also work hand in glove with employers to help future employees build skills and find the right job opportunities in an ever-evolving labor market.</li>

As workforces age and population growth decelerates, countries cannot count on excess workers to power economic growth. Absent concerted efforts to boost productivity or increases in the workforce through higher participation or immigration, many advanced economies will struggle to exceed\u0026mdash;or even match\u0026mdash;the relatively muted economic growth of the past decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, the impact of the labor market squeeze has been unevenly distributed. Job vacancies have climbed most steeply in sectors that traditionally have low productivity, such as healthcare and hospitality, as well as those with stagnant productivity, like construction. Without action, labor shortages may continue to hit sectors that struggle to increase productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTight job markets present both challenges and opportunities. Job seekers find work more easily and may garner higher wages. Yet upward wage pressure can spur inflation and stress businesses, particularly smaller ones. For instance, companies may need to turn down orders because they can\u0026rsquo;t hire enough workers to satisfy demand. At the economy level, we estimate that GDP in 2023 could have been 0.5 to 1.5 percent higher in the biggest advanced economies if employers had been able to fill their job vacancies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusinesses large and small will need strategies to confront persistent labor shortages. Deploying and adopting technologies is one way they can power productivity growth. Retraining programs can help workers gain new skills needed as technologies shift, and matching programs can pair people with jobs. Businesses also can expand their hiring pools, including by seeking to attract immigrants and people who might otherwise sit on the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst this backdrop, this article examines labor markets in advanced economies, using 20 charts to illustrate conditions in labor markets today, future prospects, and actions to address shortages. These labor markets range across 30 economies in Asia, Europe, and North America, with a particular focus on the eight largest: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"tightness-trend\"\u003eTightness is the trend\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s tight labor markets reflect longer-term trends in vacancy and unemployment rates across advanced economies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2010, labor markets have tightened across all 30 advanced economies we analyzed.[[footnote 1]] Comparing job vacancies with numbers of unemployed job seekers provides one measure of labor market tightness. The number of job vacancies per unemployed person increased by more than four times on average across these economies between 2010 and 2023, and by almost seven times in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eLabor shortages have appeared across a diverse group of countries that have no apparent common features other than their stage of development. Tightness is particularly acute in seven countries\u0026mdash;the Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, and the United States\u0026mdash;that have more vacancies than unemployed workers. Together these countries account for 53 percent of the total labor supply of the 30 advanced economies in our research, and 64 percent of collective GDP. In another seven countries, the number of job vacancies is 0.5 to 1.0 times the number of unemployed workers. Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom are in this group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not all large economies have labor shortages. For example, labor markets in France and Italy remain relatively slack, as they do in 14 other countries among the 30. This group collectively accounts for 31 percent of total labor supply and 20 percent of total GDP. Yet even in most of these places, labor markets have tightened. Vacancies per unemployed person have increased by five times in Italy and by almost four times in France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tightening trend began after the 2008 financial crisis, when job vacancies were dwarfed by a vast number of unemployed people. The recovery was slow: labor markets in these 30 economies took 8.2 years on average to reach the degree of tightness they had before the crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desire to hire carried on apace, and labor markets continued to tighten until the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in early 2020. During the pandemic, many labor markets oscillated, first to extreme looseness and then to extreme tightness. Generous fiscal stimulus measures during the crisis fueled a comparatively fast job recovery, and by 2022, labor markets had achieved the highest ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people in two decades. Today, labor markets remain historically tight but have cooled somewhat from that peak. For instance, as of April 2024, the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio in the United States had dropped to 1.2 from 1.4 at the end of the prior year.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the eight focus economies, labor markets have retreated from peak tightness during the COVID-19 pandemic toward conditions more similar to the rising prepandemic trend. Only Italy, which had one of the loosest labor markets among developed economies before the pandemic, shows no signs of declining tightness yet. This could be the result of the Italian government\u0026rsquo;s fiscal response to COVID-19, which the International Monetary Fund estimates exceeded 45 percent of the country\u0026rsquo;s GDP, making it the most generous relief package among advanced economies.[[footnote 2]] Japan, where the labor market was among the tightest before the pandemic, lags its prepandemic trend, in part because a weakening yen increased costs in the import-dependent economy. Nonetheless, job vacancies remain 1.2 times the number of job seekers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the appetite to hire continues along a rising trend line, outpacing the number of workers seeking jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[story 1]]\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"tightness-trend-bottom\" class=\"nav-bar-anchor\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"feeling-crunch\"\u003eWho\u0026rsquo;s feeling the crunch?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployers in some sectors have felt the impact of the labor shortage more than others, and the appetite for physical and manual skills has unexpectedly intensified.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[story 2]]\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"feeling-crunch-bottom\" class=\"nav-bar-anchor\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"growing-pie\"\u003eGrowing the supply-side pie\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLabor supply has struggled to keep up with overall demand due to shifts in demographics\u0026mdash;and that\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to change, according to projections to 2030.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[story 3]]\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"growing-pie-bottom\" class=\"nav-bar-anchor\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"gearing-up\"\u003eGearing up for continued tightness\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven shifting demographics, advanced economies will need to find ways to grow labor supply and increase productivity in order to maintain their current level of economic growth, and employers and policy makers can help by taking action.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[scrolly 1]]\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"gearing-up-bottom\" class=\"nav-bar-anchor\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConcerted actions can improve labor supply and productivity and better match people to jobs.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll labor market stakeholders\u0026mdash;employers, market influencers, policy makers, training institutions, and other workforce development organizations\u0026mdash;can address labor shortages. Each can act by improving supply, productivity, or matching. Action employers can take include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eImprove their value proposition for prospective talent and talent they already employ.\u003c/em\u003e Prior McKinsey research has found that some of the most sought-after talent values flexibility and meaningful work.[[footnote 3]] Providing flexibility, like hybrid working arrangements or flexible hours, and evaluating performance based on output rather than hours worked allow top talent to create more sustainability in work. Training and career advancement opportunities could attract workers to hard-to-fill occupations typically plagued by vacancies. Indeed, companies that excel at training and internal mobility achieve better talent retention as well as top-tier financial performance and more consistent and resilient performance.[[footnote 4]] Companies can also double down on retaining talent they already have by, say, improving internal social connections and investing in and developing high-quality managers.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSeek talent outside traditional hiring pools.\u003c/em\u003e Companies should seek talent in broader, more unconventional pools, including by shifting from credentials-based to skills-based hiring. They can offer more flexible work arrangements for parents and seniors contemplating retirement. Employers could also consider looking at often-overlooked groups, like recently incarcerated workers and those with gaps in their r\u0026eacute;sum\u0026eacute;s, as potential sources of untapped talent.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eUnlock talent in their own organizations through internal mobility. \u003c/em\u003eEmployers can address skill mismatches by actively shaping career pathways to help employees acquire new skills and by making mobility and rotation a vital part of company strategy. Fostering a culture of collaboration is essential to helping employees discover and build cross-functional skills, with the triple benefits of improved innovation, fewer skill gaps, and higher employee retention.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eInvest in labor-complementing and labor-substituting technology and operations to unlock productivity.\u003c/em\u003e Technology adoption can take center stage on company agendas in a tight labor environment, including a full assessment of the potential for augmentation and automation with artificial intelligence and other technologies at the level of specific occupations and work processes. Occupations in administrative support or food services, for instance, have high potential for automation, while healthcare and management occupations have little potential. Companies can then develop short- and long-term strategies to deploy technology and other process improvements to improve the efficiency and attractiveness of jobs that can be enhanced with automation. To capture the full productivity benefit of new technologies, companies also can invest in reskilling, for example through on-the-job training and coaching, creating centers of excellence to better harness skills within their workforces, and identifying skill gaps.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolicy makers and other market-making participants can take the following steps to address tight markets:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMake it easier for older workers, women, and foreign-born talent to find work.\u003c/em\u003e To increase labor force participation among older workers, policy makers can implement more flexible retirement policies that encourage workers to continue working beyond standard retirement ages. They also can design policies to support working parents, such as establishing a minimum leave and improving access to childcare, two policies that have improved female participation in some countries. The supply of workers outside of the developed world remains large, but foreign-born workers can be an immediate and significant source of labor only if properly integrated into the workforce.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSupport the building of human capital across the workforce.\u003c/em\u003e Scaling up reskilling programs and improving access to and the capacity of career-oriented schools will help improve the human capital of the workforce. Policy makers can develop incentives to support retraining and other programs needed to facilitate occupational transitions that often accompany continued technological improvement. This approach could be accelerated by artificial intelligence in some countries.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eReduce labor market barriers to help match job seekers to job openings.\u003c/em\u003e Discouraging barriers to employment, like credentialing and noncompete agreements, as well as improving housing affordability in high-productivity, job-rich regions would allow talent to migrate to where it is most needed and most valuable. Universities and workforce development programs can also work hand in glove with employers to help future employees build skills and find the right job opportunities in an ever-evolving labor market.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n[[sidebar 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eTight job markets are challenging for businesses, yet they also present opportunities to improve productivity and livelihoods.
