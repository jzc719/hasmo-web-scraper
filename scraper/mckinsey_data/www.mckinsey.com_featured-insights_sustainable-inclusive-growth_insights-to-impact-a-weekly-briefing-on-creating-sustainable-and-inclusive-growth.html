<p><em>What is the secret sauce</em> that makes some companies so successful that they earn icon status in the public markets? Investors trust members of the US-based Magnificent Seven (among them, Apple and Nvidia) or of Europe’s Granolas (among them, Nestlé and Novartis). Why? Those companies possess at least one distinguishing institutional capability—a superpower—derived from a winning combination of people, processes, and technology, write senior partners <a href="/our-people/brad-mendelson">Brad Mendelson</a>, <a href="/our-people/harald-fanderl">Harald Fanderl</a>, <a href="/our-people/homayoun-hatami">Homayoun Hatami</a>, and <a href="/our-people/liz-hilton-segel">Liz Hilton Segel</a>. Expanding on that concept, the authors have developed the VECTOR framework: vision, employees, culture, technology, organizational structure, and routines. A recent McKinsey survey found that <a href="/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/building-a-superpower-what-can-we-learn-from-the-magnificent-seven">companies incorporating one or more VECTOR elements in their transformation efforts are more likely than others to report outperforming their peers</a>. Companies seeking similar results, the authors note, can draw lessons from stock market darlings such as LVMH, which bakes quality into the long-term visions of its 75 brands; Nestlé, which encourages an entrepreneurial culture that has produced consumer hits (such as Nespresso and Nesquik); and Amazon, whose organizational model of the “single-threaded leader” (a manager focused on a single initiative) is credited for the development of the Kindle e-reader.</p>
<p><em>Women constitute half of the population and the workforce</em> and often manage their families’ medical care. Yet society has failed to prioritize theirs, which has led to a persistent gender health gap. In the United States, that disparity is largely driven by disproportionate outcomes in cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affects more than 60 million women and claims more of their lives than any other factor does. Cardiovascular disease presents in women differently from in men, yet sex- and gender-appropriate cardiac care and research remain insufficient. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that <a href="/mhi/our-insights/the-state-of-us-womens-heart-health-a-path-to-improved-health-and-financial-outcomes">over half of pregnancy-related deaths occur in the year after childbirth, yet up to 40 percent of women don’t access postpartum care</a>. Closing the CVD gender gap could recover 1.6 million years of life lost to early deaths and add $28 billion to the US economy by 2040, say senior partner <a href="/our-people/lucy-perez">Lucy Pérez</a>, partner <a href="/our-people/megan-ann-greenfield">Megan Greenfield</a>, and leaders of the American Heart Association. To achieve that goal, the authors recommend a series of actions, including increasing sex-specific clinical research, raising public awareness, tailoring prevention strategies across women&#x27;s lifespans, and improving the collection methods of women-specific data, such as menstrual cycle information, which the US National Institutes of Health calls the “fifth vital sign.” Such data are critical to developing more accurate diagnostics and treatment algorithms for women.</p>

<h4>What can climate tech companies do to achieve cost parity with climate-intensive alternatives? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/a-radical-approach-to-cost-reduction-at-climate-tech-companies">Climate tech companies can achieve significant cost savings by applying design-to-value principles in production and procurement</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/revolutionizing-procurement-leveraging-data-and-ai-for-strategic-advantage">Organizations that improve the data capabilities of their procurement functions can drive and protect value creation, particularly in the face of geopolitical and price volatility</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Despite the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions</em> and prevent a climate crisis, widespread adoption of climate tech has been hindered by an inability to achieve cost parity with traditional carbon-intensive alternatives. Controlling costs is a challenge for green businesses because of the lack of standardized components, volatile material and power costs, capital expenditure overruns, and production delays. Additionally, <a href="/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/a-radical-approach-to-cost-reduction-at-climate-tech-companies">most climate tech companies don’t prioritize cost mitigation, relying instead on subsidies, green premiums, and the actions of other stakeholders in the value chain</a> to lower product pricing, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/harry-bowcott">Harry Bowcott</a>, <a href="/our-people/rajat-gupta">Rajat Gupta</a>, and <a href="/our-people/tomas-naucler">Tomas Nauclér</a> and their coauthors. The authors propose a five-part strategy for companies seeking to drive down their production costs, including setting ambitious targets that spur innovation, deploying AI to accelerate innovation, and applying design-to-value (DTV) principles to reduce material and component costs and optimize product performance. For instance, an electrolyzer manufacturer successfully used DTV to identify up to 50 percent in cost savings for essential components. The authors note that companies with a clear cost reduction plan are more attractive than others to climate tech investors.</p>
<p><em>Analytics and AI</em> have the potential to transform procurement functions by improving sourcing decisions, particularly in an environment of price volatility, geopolitical tensions, and sustainability imperatives. However, according to senior partner <a href="/our-people/mauro-erriquez">Mauro Erriquez</a> and his coauthors, most chief procurement officers feel unprepared for this change, citing concerns about data quality and access, making the business case for new tools, and implementing them at scale. The authors contend that companies can join the data-driven procurement revolution by focusing on five or six high-value use cases that can deliver 60 to 80 percent of the value at stake, partnering with internal and external stakeholders from the outset, making new data solutions more user friendly, and investing in data and analytics talent. Notably, <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/revolutionizing-procurement-leveraging-data-and-ai-for-strategic-advantage">best-in-class companies allocate 22 percent of procurement staff to analytics teams</a>, far higher than the typical share at other organizations.</p>

    <li>The newest <em><a href="/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers">McKinsey Explainers</a></em> edition defines “circularity” as practices that optimize resource use and minimize waste across production and consumption, noting that <a href="/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-circularity">80 percent of the material value in fast-moving consumer goods is thrown away every year and never recovered</a> and highlighting the revenue opportunity it presents for companies committed to environmental, social, and governance metrics.</li>

<h4>How can gen AI help farmers feed the world? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p>This week’s headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/industries/agriculture/our-insights/from-bytes-to-bushels-how-gen-ai-can-shape-the-future-of-agriculture">Gen AI can help reshape the future of agriculture by improving efficiencies on individual farms and fields, as well as at the enterprise level</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/locations/mckinsey-client-capabilities-network/our-work/strategic-and-change-communications/the-communications-exchange/unlocking-organizational-communication-five-ways-to-ignite-employee-engagement">Excellent communications can serve as an organization’s superpower, helping leaders inspire and motivate their teams</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/state-of-consumer">Shifts in consumer behavior continue apace, making it imperative for consumer goods companies and retailers to understand what customers want</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Generative AI (gen AI) is poised to revolutionize agriculture,</em> a welcome development as global demand for nutritious food continues to increase. The nascent technology can help agricultural businesses strike a balance between sustainability and economic pressures, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/david-fiocco">David Fiocco</a> and Yashaswi Gautam and their coauthors. For farmers, gen AI can optimize the usage of inputs, such as water and fertilizers, and manage labor more efficiently, creating $100 billion in value, the authors estimate. On an enterprise level, gen AI has the power to enhance the research and development process, for example, by creating crops that can better withstand pests or drought. The authors estimate gen AI can create an additional $150 billion in value at the enterprise level. To <a href="/industries/agriculture/our-insights/from-bytes-to-bushels-how-gen-ai-can-shape-the-future-of-agriculture">capture the full potential of gen AI</a>, agricultural businesses must revamp their approach to digital efforts by building a robust data foundation, fostering a culture of experimentation and learning, and developing talent with the skills needed to make good use of the technology. </p>
<p><em>Effective communications can help businesses</em> improve employee engagement, <a href="/locations/mckinsey-client-capabilities-network/our-work/strategic-and-change-communications/the-communications-exchange/unlocking-organizational-communication-five-ways-to-ignite-employee-engagement">motivating team members and helping them do their best work</a>, senior partner <a href="/our-people/dana-maor">Dana Maor</a> and coauthors say. In a follow-up article to McKinsey’s <em><a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-state-of-organizations-2023">The State of Organizations 2023</a></em> report, which found that only a quarter of respondents think their organizations’ leaders are truly inspiring, the authors lay out five key practices for executives: embedding communications at the core of your role and choosing key messages wisely; using shared metaphors and myths to click with people; talking with, not at, your audience; making technology your assistant, not your boss; and imbuing communications with a sense of purpose.</p>
<p><em>Consumers continue to buck expectations,</em> making it harder for companies to know how to keep them happy. To assess the <a href="/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/state-of-consumer">state of the consumer in 2024</a>, McKinsey surveyed more than 15,000 people in 18 markets that collectively account for 90 percent of global GDP. Senior partner <a href="/our-people/sajal-kohli">Sajal Kohli</a> and coauthors point to three particularly influential consumer groups of the future: young people in emerging markets, who tend to be optimistic and willing to trade up to premium products; wealthy older people, eager to spend on experiences such as travel; and the squeezed middle classes in Europe and the United States, who still plan to splurge on discretionary items despite cost-of-living increases. Other key insights: brand loyalty is largely a thing of the past, benefiting private labels. Fewer young people say sustainability is an important factor in their purchasing decisions. And spending on health and wellness is expected to surge, particularly in emerging markets. </p>

<h4>What features define companies that are generating value from their use of AI? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings: </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai">Organizations could see an earnings boost if they deploy AI across three or more business functions</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-state-of-tourism-and-hospitality-2024">Tourism industry players can attract more travelers to their products and services by customizing their outreach to seven traveler archetypes</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>More companies are deploying AI</em> and seeing its benefits to their bottom line, according to results from the 2024 McKinsey Global Survey on AI, led by senior partners <a href="/our-people/alex-singla">Alex Singla</a>, <a href="/our-people/alexander-sukharevsky">Alexander Sukharevsky</a>, and <a href="/our-people/lareina-yee">Lareina Yee</a>. <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai">AI adoption has risen from 50 percent in 2022, before generative AI (gen AI) became mainstream, to 72 percent in 2024</a>. Gen AI use has surged from 33 percent in 2023 to 65 percent this year. Beyond implementation, AI solutions are beginning to generate value for organizations, driving cost savings in HR and boosting revenue in supply chain and commercial activities. The survey revealed key distinctions between a small group of high performers—which attribute more than 10 percent of their EBIT to their use of gen AI—and the rest. Relative to other organizations, high performers deploy the technology across more business functions (average of three versus average of two), are more likely to use customized or proprietary AI models, and are more proactive about mitigating gen AI’s risks, such as inaccuracies and cybersecurity issues. </p>
<p><em>Many countries and businesses rely on tourism</em> and leisure travel, which plummeted by 75 percent in 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry is poised for a full recovery by the end of 2024, with projected travel spending reaching $8.6 trillion, approximately 9 percent of this year’s projected global GDP, say the authors of McKinsey’s <a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-state-of-tourism-and-hospitality-2024">new five-part report, <em>The state of tourism and hospitality 2024</em></a>, led by senior partners <a href="/our-people/caroline-tufft">Caroline Tufft</a> and <a href="/our-people/matteo-pacca">Matteo Pacca</a>. Domestic travel is expected to remain the predominant source of tourism revenue, accounting for around 75 percent of total global travel spending in 2023 and projected to be around 70 percent of it by 2030. However, new trends in international travel are emerging: <a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-state-of-tourism-and-hospitality-2024">Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia are fast-growing sources of outbound tourists, and destinations like Peru, Rwanda, and Vietnam are attracting more visitors</a> than ever before. The report also identifies seven traveler archetypes—from culture and authenticity seekers to strategic spenders—and provides insights for tourism industry players to customize and personalize their offerings accordingly. </p>

<h4>What can businesses do to improve the living standards of millions of people? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/mgi/our-research/a-better-life-everyone-can-afford-lifting-a-quarter-billion-people-to-economic-empowerment">The public and private sectors have an opportunity to work together to lower the cost of basic goods and services to help more people across the world reach the “empowerment line.”</a></li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/ready-set-scale-shaping-leaders-for-hypergrowth">Start-ups that make intentional investments in leadership development are more likely to achieve the tricky balance of rapidly transforming while preserving the entrepreneurial spirit that created the company.</a></li>
    <li><a href="/industries/retail/our-insights/reimagining-the-apparel-value-chain-amid-volatility">Apparel brands can use digital capabilities to reach greater efficiency, improved collaboration with their suppliers, and heightened transparency.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Many people in lower- and middle-income countries</em> have built better lives thanks to economic growth, but in wealthier countries—the McKinsey Global Institute estimates—about 20 percent of the population consistently falls below the “empowerment line,” a threshold at which people can afford necessities and start saving. That’s because essentials get more expensive as countries grow wealthier. But if all countries with pricier goods and services could cut those costs to match nations with similar income levels but cheaper necessities, <a href="/mgi/our-research/a-better-life-everyone-can-afford-lifting-a-quarter-billion-people-to-economic-empowerment">about 230 million additional people could rise above the empowerment line</a>, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/kweilin-ellingrud">Kweilin Ellingrud</a> and <a href="/our-people/marco-piccitto">Marco Piccitto</a> and coauthors. Although the public sector would need to play its part in making this happen, the private sector can help by striving to offer affordable goods and services in housing, energy, food, healthcare, and communication.</p>
<p><em>Underdeveloped leadership is a key reason</em> for the 80 percent failure rate of start-ups, making intentional investment in leadership development crucial. When founders delegate effectively, they not only free up their own time and energy but also empower their employees to take on more responsibility and make decisions on their own. This fosters a sense of trust and autonomy and also <a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/ready-set-scale-shaping-leaders-for-hypergrowth">allows for growth and innovation within the company</a>, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/alok-kshirsagar">Alok Kshirsagar</a> and <a href="/our-people/arne-gast">Arne Gast</a> and coauthors. Well-developed leadership has a profound impact. McKinsey research shows that organizations performing in the top quartile of leadership have almost double the EBITDA of others. But it’s a tricky balance to strike because effective leadership at a start-up needs to allow for rapid transformation while also respecting the entrepreneurial spirit that led to the start-up’s creation.</p>
<p><em>The apparel industry faces challenges</em> due to supply chain disruptions. To thrive, <a href="/industries/retail/our-insights/reimagining-the-apparel-value-chain-amid-volatility">brands must rethink sourcing strategies, become more efficient, collaborate with suppliers, and embrace digital solutions</a>, say senior partners Karl-Hendrik Magnus and Patricio Ibáñez and coauthors. Apparel businesses understand the urgency and are focusing on efficiency, supply chain resilience, and sustainability, according to McKinsey’s latest global survey of apparel chief procurement officers and its annual apparel sourcing roundtable. AI can help companies analyze consumer data and market trends, allowing designers to create products that are innovative and in demand. By streamlining the design process, technology enables businesses to quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. Embracing digital solutions helps reduce costs and increase efficiency in supply chains. In the near term, brands should set data-driven sustainability goals, use digital tools for sourcing, and establish strong supplier relationships—practices that can help brands reinvent their supply chains and emerge stronger from current challenges.</p>

<h4>How can companies maintain global growth amid rising geopolitical tensions? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/can-your-company-remain-global-and-if-so-how">Multinationals can maintain global growth amid geopolitical uncertainty by structurally segmenting business units to localize operations and decision making</a>.  </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/beyond-the-pandemic-the-next-chapter-of-innovation-in-vaccines">Vaccine manufacturers can accelerate the innovation of therapies for infectious diseases by taking such pandemic-inspired actions as expanding global R&amp;D and manufacturing partnerships</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/master-data-management-the-key-to-getting-more-from-your-data">Organizations can boost operational efficiency by creating a “golden record” of their master data</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Escalating geopolitical conflicts and competition</em> are causing multinational companies to reevaluate their global presence, with between 60 and 70 percent of business leaders citing geopolitics as the top risk to global growth. To build resilience under these circumstances, some organizations are opting to <a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/can-your-company-remain-global-and-if-so-how">localize business operations to minimize geopolitical risks and enable locally informed decision making</a>, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/andrew-grant">Andrew Grant</a>, <a href="/our-people/michael-birshan">Michael Birshan</a>, <a href="/our-people/olivia-white">Olivia White</a>, and partner <a href="/our-people/ziad-haider">Ziad Haider</a>. That strategy, called structural segmentation, helps stabilize growth by allowing companies to adapt to legal, regulatory, and economic shifts while maintaining a global footprint. However, structural segmentation may also require companies to navigate such challenges as replicating supplier networks in new markets and maintaining a unified corporate culture across the various segments. </p>
<p><em>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,</em> an unprecedented level of collaboration and cooperation between manufacturers, research centers, academia, and government regulators across the globe led to the compression of the vaccine development timeline from an average of ten years to just 12 months. Four years later, vaccine innovation remains strong, with some respiratory-disease vaccines now being developed in three to five years and a surge in late-stage candidates in the clinical pipeline, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/adam-sabow">Adam Sabow</a> and <a href="/our-people/michael-conway">Michael Conway</a> and their coauthors. The authors note, however, that <a href="/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/beyond-the-pandemic-the-next-chapter-of-innovation-in-vaccines">innovation has been uneven across vaccine archetypes</a>, with few vaccine candidates progressing to late-stage development for “neglected diseases” such as Lassa fever or for “persistent global threats” such as HIV and hepatitis C. To accelerate innovation across all vaccine archetypes, the authors recommend five actions, including expanding R&amp;D and manufacturing partnerships and establishing commercial demand through international funding mechanisms. </p>
<p><em>Accurate and accessible master data</em>—core information about customers, suppliers, products, and employees—is essential for personnel across an organization’s business functions. Master data management (MDM) organizes and standardizes this data, propelling operational efficiency and decision making. However, senior partners <a href="/our-people/kayvaun-rowshankish">Kayvaun Rowshankish</a> and <a href="/our-people/holger-harreis">Holger Harreis</a> and their coauthors note that many organizations struggle to implement MDM because of challenges with overcoming data silos and justifying the cost of MDM implementation. For organizations that see its value, for example, in enhancing customer experience, one critical step is to <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/master-data-management-the-key-to-getting-more-from-your-data">create an MDM “golden record” that consolidates the most up-to-date information from every business unit</a>. AI can be instrumental in integrating this data. Yet a 2023 McKinsey survey reveals that 69 percent of organizations are not yet using advanced AI techniques for that purpose. </p>

<h4>What actions can private asset managers take to outperform over the next decade? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/industries/private-capital/our-insights/five-alphas-essential-capabilities-to-succeed-in-the-next-era-of-private-capital">Private capital firms can outperform over the next decade if they excel in five “alphas” of asset management</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/mhi/our-insights/in-search-of-self-and-something-bigger-a-spiritual-health-exploration">Employers can help Gen Z improve their spiritual health by creating purposeful mission statements, offering opportunities for pro bono work, and fostering a supportive work environment</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment,</em> private market assets under management could triple to more than $30 trillion by 2034, driven by new investment needs and the governance advantage of private capital. However, they face near-term fundraising challenges due to high interest rates, a reengineering of supply chains, and a shift to a lower-carbon economy. <a href="/industries/private-capital/our-insights/five-alphas-essential-capabilities-to-succeed-in-the-next-era-of-private-capital">Outperforming in this climate, and over the next decade, will require private capital firms to excel in at least two of five “alphas,”</a> say senior partners <a href="/our-people/aly-jeddy">Aly Jeddy</a>, <a href="/our-people/john-kelleher">John Kelleher</a>, and <a href="/our-people/ju-hon-kwek">Ju-Hon Kwek</a> and their coauthor. These include the sales alpha (raising capital effectively), the sourcing alpha (creating bespoke investment opportunities), the operational alpha (postacquisition value creation), the exit alpha (successful asset monetization), and the organizational alpha (client-centric, repeatable, and scalable operations). Success in these areas will help firms capture strong returns, growth, and profitability in the evolving private capital landscape.</p>
<p><em>Many people, particularly Gen Zers, struggle</em> to find meaning and purpose in their lives, which affects their work and overall well-being. Developed by partners <a href="/our-people/erica-coe">Erica Coe</a> and <a href="/our-people/kana-enomoto">Kana Enomoto</a> and their coauthors, the <a href="/mhi/overview">McKinsey Health Institute’s</a> Global Gen Z Survey of 41,000 people across 26 countries reveals that, despite generational and regional differences, most respondents value spiritual health. Notably, more than 80 percent in Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam consider it very important, compared with less than 45 percent in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden. <a href="/mhi/our-insights/in-search-of-self-and-something-bigger-a-spiritual-health-exploration">Poor spiritual health, particularly among Gen Z respondents, correlates with lower mental, social, and physical health</a>. Employers and stakeholders can support spiritual well-being by helping individuals find purpose in their work and lives, highlighting the interconnectedness of the various dimensions of health.</p>

<h4>What steps can micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises take to boost their productivity? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/mgi/our-research/a-microscope-on-small-businesses-spotting-opportunities-to-boost-productivity">Small and medium-size companies can add up to 10 percent annually to global GDP if they close the productivity gap with large enterprises</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/from-hire-to-inspire-getting-and-keeping-gen-z-in-manufacturing">US manufacturers can address their labor shortage by appealing to Gen Z’s desire for flexibility and meaning in their work</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-rapid-evolution-of-payments-in-latin-america">Banks in Latin America can offer tailored digital solutions to the 70 percent of consumers who say they prefer noncash payment options</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>From laundromats to dental practices</em>, micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) account for two-thirds of employment in advanced economies and nearly four-fifths in emerging markets. However, their productivity significantly lags behind that of larger companies, particularly in emerging countries. Closing this productivity gap could boost global GDP by 5–10 percent, say McKinsey Global Institute director <a href="/our-people/olivia-white">Olivia White</a> and coauthors. Drawing from their granular analysis of 16 economies across various sectors, the authors recommend that <a href="/mgi/our-research/a-microscope-on-small-businesses-spotting-opportunities-to-boost-productivity">MSMEs collaborate with large firms to enhance R&amp;D and technology capabilities, cooperate for knowledge and resource sharing</a>, and use government policy support to access technology, new markets, and financing. They argue that improving MSME productivity benefits both MSMEs and large enterprises, as their productivity moves in tandem in most subsectors.</p>
<p><em>Gen Z could be the answer</em> to the US manufacturing labor shortage, wherein barely six in ten vacancies have been filled since 2020. Although Gen Z has demonstrated a greater interest in manufacturing careers than previous generations have, and more comfort with its technologies, they also value meaningful work, career development, flexibility, and caring leadership, according to research by senior partner <a href="/our-people/fernando-perez">Fernando Perez</a> and coauthors. To attract and retain these younger workers, <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/from-hire-to-inspire-getting-and-keeping-gen-z-in-manufacturing">manufacturers could offer flexible work arrangements, provide skills-based training that empowers them to solve operational issues</a>, and connect their work to a broader sense of purpose. But leaders should act swiftly to engage their Gen Z workforce, the authors say, given that 48 percent of them intend to leave their positions within three to six months.</p>
<p><em>Cash may soon lose its luster</em> in Latin America, where many people still receive wages and make purchases exclusively in cash. That’s because the region is rapidly undergoing “bancarization,” the expansion of financial services, including online banking, to the unbanked population. A 2023 survey by partner Jesús Moreno and coauthors reveals that <a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-rapid-evolution-of-payments-in-latin-america">70 percent of Spanish-speaking Latin American consumers prefer noncash payments, such as debit cards, credit cards, and mobile payments</a>, compared with just 41 percent in their 2021 survey. The authors suggest that this trend presents opportunities for banks and financial-services companies in the region to innovate and customize payment solutions that improve customer experiences. They can make their offerings more appealing to specific customer segments that favor one digital payment method over another; 17 percent of millennials in Latin America, for example, prefer mobile payments, while only 12 percent of Gen Z consumers do.</p>

<h4>Which sectors could see the greatest value from quantum technologies by 2035? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage">Quantum technology (QT) innovation clusters could open up access to training and advanced technologies for the 367,000 students graduating globally with QT-relevant degrees</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/from-margins-to-mainstream-asians-and-pacific-islanders-in-hollywood">Entertainment studios could unlock more than $2 billion annually if they can appeal to Asian and Pacific Islander consumers who feel their cultures, stories, and experiences are not authentically represented</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/gen-ai-in-customer-care-early-successes-and-challenges">Customer care centers that are testing generative AI can follow a three-step approach to go from internal use cases to customer-facing applications</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Quantum technologies</em>, which include computing, sensing, and communication, offer significant performance improvements over their classical counterparts. Early commercial applications are emerging from labs, with the potential to generate a combined $2 trillion in value across the chemicals, life sciences, finance, and mobility sectors by 2035, according to analysis in McKinsey’s third annual <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage"><em>Quantum Technology Monitor</em></a> written by senior partner <a href="/our-people/rodney-zemmel">Rodney Zemmel</a> and colleagues. <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage">Global funding for QT development and commercialization also continues to surge</a>: despite a 27 percent decrease in private funding for QT start-ups in 2023 (less drastic than the 38 percent dip for all start-ups), global public investments surged more than 50 percent, bringing the total to about $42 billion. The authors note the emergence of regional innovation clusters, which bring together industry, academia, and government to accelerate technology development and commercialization. Such collaborations, they argue, are also crucial for building up the capabilities of the 367,000 students who graduated in 2023 with QT-relevant degrees and giving them access to state-of-the-art hardware. </p>
<p><em>Despite recent gains</em> in Asian and Pacific Islander (API) representation in film and television, more than 70 percent of API consumers still perceive a lack of authenticity in portraying their stories and experiences on-screen. That’s a missed opportunity for the entertainment industry, say senior partner <a href="/our-people/kabir-ahuja">Kabir Ahuja</a> and coauthors. Their research found that nearly half of Asian Americans indicated they’d spend more money on film and TV and consume more content if API experiences were more authentically represented. Their analysis estimates that <a href="/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/from-margins-to-mainstream-asians-and-pacific-islanders-in-hollywood">improving the authenticity of API representation could unlock $2 billion to $4 billion in annual revenues</a> today and could double that by 2060. The authors recommend specific actions, such as promoting API professionals to leadership roles with green-lighting authority, establishing dedicated funds for API projects, and considering international market potential when evaluating projects.</p>
<p><em>Although generative AI</em> has the potential to revolutionize contact centers, it has yet to be widely adopted because of inconsistent data quality, a misunderstanding of the use cases, and inadequate change management (because it’s <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/how-we-help-clients">never just tech</a>). To address these challenges, senior partner Rohit Sood and coauthors suggest that organizations <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/gen-ai-in-customer-care-early-successes-and-challenges">conduct AI readiness assessments of their servicing strategies, operations, technologies, and talent capabilities</a>. They also propose a three-stage approach to build up AI proficiency and demonstrate its impact: starting with lower-risk tools and basic use cases, then expanding to internal use cases such as human agents using AI for knowledge extraction and summarization, and finally, deploying customized applications such as empathetic and intelligent AI agents.</p>

<h4>What does it take to double industry performance in healthcare? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s</strong> headline findings: </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/industries/healthcare/our-insights/value-creation-through-business-model-innovation-in-us-healthcare">Healthcare systems that build distinctive capabilities around their primary business model can release untapped value within the ecosystem</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it">US states can ensure equitable deployment of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funds by engaging diverse stakeholders and promoting investment transparency</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/accelerating-innovation-the-potential-of-digital-twins-in-medtech-r-and-d">Medtech companies could cut clinical trial costs by up to 75 percent by adopting digital-twin technologies</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Within a complex and evolving healthcare landscape,</em> an organization’s business model is crucial for value creation. Most US healthcare systems adopt some combination of two primary models: vertical integration (owning multiple segments of the healthcare value chain) or pure-play specialization (focusing on core activities). In recent years, <a href="/industries/healthcare/our-insights/value-creation-through-business-model-innovation-in-us-healthcare">vertical integration models have experienced much stronger growth rates</a>, according to research by senior partner <a href="/our-people/shubham-singhal">Shubham Singhal</a> and coauthors; for instance, “capital light” integrated delivery models, which exclude capital-intensive acute care facilities, doubled the performance of the overall healthcare industry from 2017 to 2022. The authors note, however, that both models could be optimized to spur growth: for example, vertically integrated models can excel through digital member engagement, and pure-play models can succeed by enhancing productivity and onboarding technologies such as AI and automation. Regardless of the primary model chosen, organizations must develop distinctive capabilities to unlock the more than $1 trillion in value that Singhal and colleagues estimate exists within the healthcare ecosystem.
</p>
<p><em>Following the landmark passage</em> in 2022 of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—a $500 billion investment in clean energy, healthcare, and tax reforms—state governments are transitioning from designing programs to secure federal grants and efficiently deploy funds to implementing them in 2024. <a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it">A recent update to McKinsey’s 2022 IRA analysis</a> by senior partner <a href="/our-people/adi-kumar">Adi Kumar</a> and coauthors features a summary of implementation insights from four related McKinsey articles. These articles offer strategies for states to accelerate decarbonization, such as establishing a comprehensive emissions baseline, and to promote equity in program delivery, such as involving diverse stakeholders in the decision-making process and committing to a transparent investment process.
</p>
<p><em>Digital twins—virtual replicas</em> of real-world systems, products, or processes—have the potential to accelerate innovation in the medtech industry by reducing R&amp;D costs and enabling personalized patient care. However, medtech companies face challenges in adopting this technology, including a shortage of suitable capabilities, limited data access, and a lack of clear strategies. To facilitate successful implementation and eventual scaling, senior partner Jack Donohew and coauthors recommend <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/accelerating-innovation-the-potential-of-digital-twins-in-medtech-r-and-d">a three-pronged agile approach to digital-twin delivery</a>: start with high-feasibility use cases, build a test-and-learn culture, and engage potential users in the design, development, and implementation stages. Already, real-world medtech applications of digital twins have demonstrated 20 to 50 percent reductions in time-to-market and 75 percent reductions in clinical trial costs.

<h4>How can companies help employees who lack skills, will, and time management capacity? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/increasing-your-return-on-talent-the-moves-and-metrics-that-matter">Companies with effective HR functions can take five actions to boost employee productivity—and organizational performance with it</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/industries/private-capital/our-insights/bridging-private-equitys-value-creation-gap">Private equity firms can improve fund performance by prioritizing operational value creation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Productivity can vary widely, </em>with top-performing employees delivering up to eight times the productivity of average performers in the same role. But that talent gap is costing companies, say senior partner <a href="/our-people/vincent-berube">Vincent Bérubé</a> and coauthors. Their research indicates that <a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/increasing-your-return-on-talent-the-moves-and-metrics-that-matter">a lack of skills, motivation, and time management efficiency is driving up attrition and vacancy rates</a>, which could cost a median-size S&amp;P 500 company roughly $480 million a year in lost productivity. The authors contend that companies should view their employees as their most valuable resource, and they recommend five HR-led actions to take to maximize the organization’s “return on talent,” among them, investing in tailored learning and development programs and fostering a high-performance culture.</p>
<p><em>Private equity buyout managers </em>have historically relied on debt-funded acquisitions and boosting valuations to generate returns. Fund performance, however, has suffered since 2020 due to rising debt costs and tighter liquidity. In the current environment, <a href="/industries/private-capital/our-insights/bridging-private-equitys-value-creation-gap">PE buyout managers can improve fund performance by prioritizing operational efficiency</a> in their assessment and management of portfolio companies, say senior partners <a href="/our-people/jose-luis-blanco">Jose Luis Blanco</a> and <a href="/our-people/jason-phillips">Jason Phillips</a> and their coauthors. Their analysis reveals that PE general partners who focus on creating value through operational improvements have boosted their internal rates of return by two to three percentage points.</p>

<h4>How can space technology help boost revenues for industries outside of core space services? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/space-the-1-point-8-trillion-dollar-opportunity-for-global-economic-growth">Companies outside of the space industry can derive economic benefits from advances in space technology and AI-enabled insights of space data</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/addressing-continued-turbulence-the-commercial-aerospace-supply-chain">Aerospace OEMs can quickly reduce a severe parts shortage by adopting a comprehensive approach to supply chain management</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/tradespeople-wanted-the-need-for-critical-trade-skills-in-the-us">Construction and manufacturing companies could participate in regional public–private collaborations focused on training and recruiting new skilled tradespeople</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The space economy</em> is rapidly expanding, driven by surging demand for satellite connectivity, positioning, navigation, and AI-enabled insights of extensive Earth-observation data sets. According to research led by senior partner <a href="/our-people/ryan-brukardt">Ryan Brukardt</a> and collaborators at McKinsey and the World Economic Forum, <a href="/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/space-the-1-point-8-trillion-dollar-opportunity-for-global-economic-growth">the space industry could grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035, from $630 billion in 2023</a>. Over 60 percent of that growth will be propelled by “reach” applications in industries such as supply chain and transportation, food, consumer goods, and digital communications—outpacing the expected contribution from “backbone” industry sectors like space hardware, space launchers, and satellite services. The authors note that even space tourism and manufacturing are poised to generate revenues by 2035.</p>
<p><em>Commercial aerospace</em> is grappling with a record order backlog of more than 15,000 aircraft, which, at current production rates, would take 13 years to be cleared. At the core of the issue are supply chain disruptions, an issue raised 18 times more often by aerospace executives on earnings calls in 2022 compared with 2014, note senior partner <a href="/our-people/mike-parkins">Mike Parkins</a> and coauthors. To reduce the backlog and mitigate against further disruptions, the authors recommend <a href="/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/addressing-continued-turbulence-the-commercial-aerospace-supply-chain">a comprehensive approach focused on using data and analytics for greater supply chain visibility</a>, fostering cross-functional collaboration and talent upskilling, and proactively assessing risks. This comprehensive strategy, they say, has helped one aerospace parts manufacturer quickly reduce shortages by over 25 percent.</p>
<p><em>Construction and manufacturing</em> in the United States is facing a severe shortage of skilled tradespeople due to high churn from the COVID-19 pandemic, an aging workforce, and too few young people pursuing these roles. For critical skilled trades roles, there could be 20 job openings annually for every single net new employee added between 2022 and 2032, say senior partner <a href="/our-people/brooke-weddle">Brooke Weddle</a> and coauthors. Their analysis of US Bureau of Labor Statistics data also suggests that <a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/tradespeople-wanted-the-need-for-critical-trade-skills-in-the-us">companies may have to spend up to $5.3 billion annually to hire and train new talent to fill these roles</a>. To plug leaks in the talent pipeline, the authors recommend regional collaboration among employers, educators, and government to support training, recruitment initiatives (such as attractive sign-on bonuses and relocation packages), and productivity boosters (such as using “cobots,” or collaborative robots, to automate rote tasks). </p>

<h4>How can retailers use loyalty, pricing, and personalization to deliver greater value to cost-conscious customers? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/members-only-delivering-greater-value-through-loyalty-and-pricing">Retailers can boost gross profit margins by two to four percentage points through personalized marketing and pricing offers</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/healthcare/our-insights/how-to-bridge-the-experience-gap-by-supporting-nurses-of-all-tenures">Healthcare organizations can retain early- and mid-tenure nurses by offering flexible schedules and teaching and mentorship opportunities</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In today’s challenging economic landscape</em>, retailers must find ways to stand out and attract hesitant shoppers. Most companies do so through loyalty programs, pricing strategies, and promotions. However, senior partner <a href="/our-people/emily-reasor">Emily Reasor</a> and coauthors suggest a more effective approach: developing and deploying an integrated and customized customer strategy and experience. They note, for example, that <a href="/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/members-only-delivering-greater-value-through-loyalty-and-pricing">companies piloting personalized pricing and marketing have seen two to four percentage point increases in gross profit margins</a>, compared with those using standard offers. Realizing the full value of integration and personalization, they say, will require retailers to overcome three important challenges: coordinating cross-functional teams, building analytical capabilities, and delivering a clear and simple customer experience.</p>
<p><em>Toxic workplaces</em>, interpersonal conflicts, and negative team dynamics are contributing to burnout and rising attrition among US nurses. A recent survey of nearly 6,000 nurses conducted by senior partner <a href="/our-people/gretchen-berlin">Gretchen Berlin</a> and collaborators at McKinsey and the American Nurses Foundation found that <a href="/industries/healthcare/our-insights/how-to-bridge-the-experience-gap-by-supporting-nurses-of-all-tenures">45 percent of early-tenure nurses (less than five years of experience) may leave their roles within six months</a>, compared with 27 percent of most-tenured nurses (21 or more years). To retain nurses, the authors recommend that healthcare leaders offer flexible schedules, create mentorship programs, and foster a positive work environment through team-building exercises and enforcement of anti-bullying policies. Addressing these workforce challenges is crucial for strengthening the nursing pipeline and ensuring adequate staffing for quality patient care.</p>

<h4>Why the world’s largest financial institutions are choosing centralization as their generative AI operating model. Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/scaling-gen-ai-in-banking-choosing-the-best-operating-model">Banks may unlock up to $340 billion in annual value if they choose the right generative AI operating model</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/making-green-logistics-services-profitable">Logistics companies can shift the green-services conversation from cost to value</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/shaping-tomorrows-talent-agenda-for-the-public-sector">Public sector leaders can attract Gen Z talent by making a compelling employee value proposition</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The McKinsey Global Institute</em> estimates that generative AI (gen AI) could boost the global banking sector’s annual revenue by $200 billion to $340 billion, mainly through productivity gains. However, many financial institutions still face significant challenges in deploying gen AI effectively. To address this, senior partner <a href="/our-people/kevin-buehler">Kevin Buehler</a> and his coauthors advocate for <a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/scaling-gen-ai-in-banking-choosing-the-best-operating-model">an operating model that manages gen AI’s unique features and risks</a>. They note that a centralized model has been the most successful approach for more than half of the 16 largest financial institutions in Europe and the United States. Central oversight allows for streamlined talent management, risk mitigation, technology updates, and application scaling. As the technology matures, the authors expect a shift toward decentralization.</p>
<p><em>Fueled by Scope 3 emissions targets</em>, demand for green transportation is projected to surge from a projected 2 percent of logistics spending in 2025 to 15 percent by 2030. Despite this strong demand signal, logistics companies are struggling to make green services profitable. To bridge the gap, senior partner <a href="/our-people/matteo-pacca">Matteo Pacca</a> and coauthors argue that <a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/making-green-logistics-services-profitable">logistics companies could shift the conversation from cost to value</a> by bundling green offerings with premium services and collaborating with their customers to show end consumers the environmental benefits of premium pricing.</p>
<p><em>An aging global population</em> is reshaping the demand for government services, yet the public sector workforce isn’t keeping pace. Gen Z is expected to comprise 30 percent of the global workforce by 2030 but represented only 1.6 percent of the US federal workforce in 2021. Averting this looming talent crisis will require a holistic approach to talent management, say senior partner <a href="/our-people/julia-klier">Julia Klier</a> and coauthors. They outline <a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/shaping-tomorrows-talent-agenda-for-the-public-sector">six priorities that public sector leaders can deploy</a> to harness—rather than be overwhelmed by—the shifting demographic trends, including developing a compelling employee value proposition and establishing dynamic career pathways.</p>

<h4>Many organizations are prioritizing generative AI, but few feel comfortable implementing it responsibly. Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/implementing-generative-ai-with-speed-and-safety">Organizations need a plan to implement and scale generative AI responsibly</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/mhi/our-insights/working-nine-to-thrive">Companies can influence six key drivers of their employees’ health</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-economic-inclusion">By boosting productivity, businesses can help to close the global economic empowerment gap</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Generative AI (gen AI) promises </em>to boost innovation and productivity and add trillions to the global economy. However, this rapidly evolving technology carries risks such as bias, misinformation, and security vulnerabilities. A recent McKinsey survey reveals that 63 percent of organizations see gen AI as a priority, yet 91 percent of these respondents feel unprepared to manage the risks. To address this concern, senior partners <a href="/our-people/ida-kristensen">Ida Kristensen</a> and <a href="/our-people/lareina-yee">Lareina Yee</a> and coauthors offer <a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/implementing-generative-ai-with-speed-and-safety">a blueprint for responsible gen AI implementation</a> that includes focusing on efficient risk assessment, establishing a governance structure that balances technical expertise and oversight, and providing targeted training to end users.</p>
<p><em>One-third of the average</em> person’s life—more than 90,000 hours—is spent at work. By prioritizing employee health, companies can reduce absenteeism, turnover, “presenteeism,” and work-related injuries and illnesses, argue partner <a href="/our-people/barbara-jeffery">Barbara Jeffery</a>, senior partner <a href="/our-people/patrick-simon">Patrick Simon</a>, and colleagues at the McKinsey Health Institute. They’ve identified <a href="/mhi/our-insights/working-nine-to-thrive">six key drivers of employee health</a> and well-being that employers can influence: among them, social interactions, mindsets and beliefs, and economic security. Healthier employees mean healthier businesses and societies, which, the authors estimate, could unlock $3.7 trillion to $11.7 trillion in value, equivalent to a 4 to 12 percent boost to the global GDP. </p>
<p><em>More than half of the</em> world’s eight billion people are not economically empowered, lacking the means to afford adequate nutrition, education, healthcare, and other essentials. The newest <em><a href="/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers">McKinsey Explainer</a></em>, which explores the question, “<a href="/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-economic-inclusion">What is economic inclusion?</a>,” asserts that closing the economic empowerment gap (while also achieving net-zero emissions by 2030) would require additional resources amounting to 8 percent of annual global GDP. <a href="/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-economic-inclusion">Businesses could be crucial in bridging this divide by creating high-productivity jobs and upskilling their workforce</a>, especially those at risk of AI automation. Beyond the productivity benefits, a true inclusive economy, argues McKinsey’s chief client officer <a href="/our-people/liz-hilton-segel">Liz Hilton Segel</a>, is one that provides opportunities for underserved people and communities, creates higher-wage and more fulfilling jobs, and meets people’s mental health needs.</p>

<h4>Generative AI sets higher demands on organizations for productivity, performance, and personalization in customer care. Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/where-is-customer-care-in-2024">Customer care leaders are prioritizing revenue goals and technology transformation</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-cyber-clock-is-ticking-derisking-emerging-technologies-in-financial-services">Cybersecurity risks are on the rise for financial institutions</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-journey-toward-ai-enabled-railway-companies">Railway companies could become more data-driven by deploying AI at scale</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Customer demands.</em></strong> Organizational customer care leaders find themselves trapped in no-man’s-land as they balance preparing for an AI-enabled future with managing escalating customer expectations in a rapidly digitizing contact center environment. Partners <a href="/our-people/eric-buesing">Eric Buesing</a>, <a href="/our-people/julian-raabe">Julian Raabe</a>, and coauthors report that <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/where-is-customer-care-in-2024">more than 80 percent of organizations are investing in generative AI or plan to do so soon</a>, even as 57 percent anticipate increased call volumes in the next one to two years. Leaders are responding by prioritizing technology upgrades, operational efficiency, employee upskilling, and outsourcing partnerships—all while enhancing the customer experience and hitting revenue targets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cyber risks in finance. </em></strong>Financial institutions are rapidly adopting emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and AI, but <a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-cyber-clock-is-ticking-derisking-emerging-technologies-in-financial-services">70 percent believe they are underspending on cybersecurity to mitigate growing risks</a>. A recent report from partner <a href="/our-people/justin-greis">Justin Greis</a>, McKinsey colleagues, and collaborators at the Institute of International Finance reveals shortfalls in key capabilities such as third-party risk management (a top weakness for 65 percent of institutions) and attracting skilled talent. The report urges strategic alignment of tech priorities with security investments to harness these transformative technologies securely.</p>
<p><strong><em>Data-driven railways.</em></strong> AI could unlock $13 billion to $22 billion annually for the relatively data-sparse railway industry. Still, <a href="/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-journey-toward-ai-enabled-railway-companies">only 25 percent of rail companies have successfully adopted AI at scale</a>, write senior partner <a href="/our-people/nicola-sandri">Nicola Sandri</a> and coauthors. The most mature at-scale use cases include shift optimization, predictive maintenance, and security. The authors note that railways can unlock these technologies’ transformative potential by setting clear technology objectives, investing in talent upskilling, and partnering with data-driven organizations.</p>

<h4>Why organizational surgery may be needed before companies can see the full benefits of generative AI. Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/a-generative-ai-reset-rewiring-to-turn-potential-into-value-in-2024">Rewired companies could capture greater value from generative AI</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/how-generative-ai-can-help-banks-manage-risk-and-compliance">Banks can use generative AI to manage risk and automate tasks</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-rising-complexity-of-board-directorship">Board directors are bearing a heavier workload</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Organizational rewiring.</em></strong> Companies are finding that realizing the potential value of generative AI (gen AI)—for everything from customer service to content creation—is harder than expected. According to senior partners <a href="/our-people/eric-lamarre">Eric Lamarre</a>, <a href="/our-people/alex-singla">Alex Singla</a>, <a href="/our-people/alexander-sukharevsky">Alexander Sukharevsky</a>, and <a href="/our-people/rodney-zemmel">Rodney Zemmel</a>, to truly benefit from gen AI, <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/a-generative-ai-reset-rewiring-to-turn-potential-into-value-in-2024">organizations must focus on rewiring the business for distributed digital and AI innovation</a>. That involves developing the capabilities to broadly innovate, deploy, and improve scalable solutions. They note that the cost to build an AI model is often a small portion (10–15 percent) of the total cost—the real investment lies in making it work at scale.</p>
<p><strong><em>Banking on gen AI.</em></strong> Gen AI has the potential to enhance risk management, compliance, and decision making in the banking industry. Senior partner <a href="/our-people/ida-kristensen">Ida Kristensen</a> and coauthors share <a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/how-generative-ai-can-help-banks-manage-risk-and-compliance">how banks can improve efficiency and strengthen risk prevention</a> by deploying virtual experts, automating manual processes, and accelerating code development. However, banks may also need to build or invest in high-quality data sets to ensure the accuracy of their gen AI applications.</p>
<p><strong><em>Board director responsibilities.</em> </strong>As the business world becomes more complex, <a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-rising-complexity-of-board-directorship">board directors face a growing number of responsibilities</a>, including keeping up with the latest developments in geopolitics, technology, and sustainability. They’re also expected to engage more deeply with senior management on strategy, investments, M&amp;A, talent, and organizational issues. In a recent episode of the <em>Inside the Strategy Room</em> podcast, McKinsey senior partner <a href="/our-people/frithjof-lund">Frithjof Lund</a> and corporate board members Karen McLoughlin and Steven Sterin share tips that board directors can use to create value, including inviting new directors to meet on-site with the company’s frontline leadership. Given the likelihood of ever-increasing responsibilities, Sterin suggests that directors may also need to consider reducing the number of boards they serve on. </p>

<h4>Will AI be to the Fourth Industrial Revolution what steam was to the first? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week’s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/adopting-ai-at-speed-and-scale-the-4ir-push-to-stay-competitive">AI is powering a Fourth Industrial Revolution.</a></li>

    <li><a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/deploying-generative-ai-in-us-state-governments-pilot-scale-adopt">American state governments could benefit from deploying gen AI.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Just as the</em> First Industrial Revolution was powered by steam, our current <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/adopting-ai-at-speed-and-scale-the-4ir-push-to-stay-competitive">Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) will be powered by AI</a>. Enabled by the capture of terabytes of data from a broad range of sources, AI can accelerate industrial innovation. Senior partner <a href="/our-people/enno-de-boer">Enno de Boer</a> and coauthors suggest that organizations at the forefront of 4IR won’t, for instance, run narrow trials to transform factories but will instead use entire factories as pilots for networkwide deployment. </p>
<p><em>A compelling</em> equity story is necessary to attract capital from large, sophisticated investors. Partners <a href="/our-people/jamie-koenig">Jamie Koenig</a>, <a href="/our-people/anna-mattsson">Anna Mattsson</a>, and coauthors detail mistakes companies often make when attempting to convince these investors. To <a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-equity-story-you-need-for-the-long-term-investors-you-want">convey a winning equity story</a>, leaders should avoid canned presentations and instead articulate a plan for long-term value creation that’s backed by evidence of tangible steps already taken. It’s important to focus on a limited number of vital themes and make sure they’re contextualized within broader industry trends. </p>
<p><em>Generative AI</em> (gen AI) <a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/deploying-generative-ai-in-us-state-governments-pilot-scale-adopt">could be transformative for American state governments</a>.

<h4>Why do healthy organizations outperform unhealthy ones by as much as three to one? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week<strong>’</strong>s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/organizational-health-is-still-the-key-to-long-term-performance">Healthy organizations that survive and thrive through volatility display four common foundational behaviors.</a></li>
    <li><a href="/bem/our-insights/location-location-location-the-impact-of-place-on-racial-equity">Black US residents are doing better in the suburbs than in other locations but still fall short of parity.</a></li>
    <li><a href="/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/what-to-expect-from-medtech-in-2024">The medtech industry may experience another banner year of innovation.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>More than two decades</em> of McKinsey research shows that organizational health remains the top indicator of a company’s long-term success and sustained performance. According to McKinsey senior partner <a href="/our-people/arne-gast">Arne Gast</a> and coauthors, <a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/organizational-health-is-still-the-key-to-long-term-performance">healthy organizations exhibit four foundational behaviors</a>, among them a clear plan to execute their vision and strategy and a keen awareness of their position in the competitive landscape. They also deliver three times the TSR of unhealthy organizations. In one study, companies that improved their organizational health saw a notable 18 percent increase in EBITDA within just a year.</p>
<p><em>In the US, Black residents</em> continue to lag their White neighbors in health, economic, and social outcomes, according to a report on <a href="/bem/our-insights/location-location-location-the-impact-of-place-on-racial-equity">the impact of location on the state of racial equity in the US</a>. On a recent episode of <em>The McKinsey Podcast</em>, McKinsey partner <a href="/our-people/john-paul-julien">JP Julien</a> notes that Black residents are doing better in the suburbs, which benefit from their proximity to high-growth cities, than in other locations but not nearly as well as they could be. Julien says that closing the racial wealth gap will require sustained private and public investment in housing, education, and economic opportunities.</p>
<p><em>For much of the past decade</em>, the medtech industry enjoyed strong results. In recent years, however, performance has been mixed. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a record number of novel devices, but medtech companies’ profits still fell short of investor expectations. McKinsey senior partners <a href="/our-people/karsten-dalgaard">Karsten Dalgaard</a>, <a href="/our-people/gerti-pellumbi">Gerti Pellumbi</a>, and <a href="/our-people/peter-pfeiffer">Peter Pfeiffer</a> and colleagues expect another strong year of innovation in 2024, especially in the cardiovascular, digital-health-device, and neuromodulation segments. <a href="/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/what-to-expect-from-medtech-in-2024">Industry growth could exceed prepandemic rates in the new year</a>, with China, Japan, and the US continuing to lead the way, but performance across geographies could remain uneven. </p>

<h4>Differences in outcomes for Black Americans can be tied to community types. Our weekly digest explores topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week<strong>’</strong>s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/bem/our-insights/the-state-of-black-residents-the-relevance-of-place-to-racial-equity-and-outcomes">Outcomes for Black Americans can vary widely based on community type.</a></li>

    </a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/here-to-stay-an-attractive-future-for-medical-aesthetics">The medical-aesthetics market is growing and potentially underserved.</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>A new report</em> on <a href="/bem/our-insights/the-state-of-black-residents-the-relevance-of-place-to-racial-equity-and-outcomes">the state of Black residents</a> looks at differences in outcomes for Black Americans living in various types of communities. Outcomes are broadly better in suburban and high-growth areas of the United States, but these places generally have smaller Black populations. In almost no areas are outcomes for Black residents on par with those of their White neighbors, and, at current rates of change, it could take centuries to achieve racial parity within communities. Senior partner <a href="/our-people/shelley-stewart">Shelley Stewart III</a> and coauthors identify affordable housing and early-childhood education as priority areas for action when it comes to narrowing racial gaps in a wide range of locales.</p>
<p><em>The payments industry</em> is confronting greater risk, intensifying regulatory scrutiny, and shifting global standards. There are indications that delinquency levels could ramp up, which may render some prior credit models unreliable. Prioritizing risk management could help payments services providers reduce potential liabilities, protect customers, and maintain regulatory compliance. But risk management isn’t only about downside: partners <a href="/our-people/ishanaa-rambachan">Ishanaa Rambachan</a>, Julian Sevillano, Vasiliki Stergiou, and coauthors say that <a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-future-of-the-payments-industry-how-managing-risk-can-drive-growth">risk can be a lever for growth</a>. With strong risk management in place, companies can consider, for instance, entering markets or segments that they might previously have avoided.</p>
<p><em>The medical-aesthetics market</em>, which includes neuromodulators (such as injectable Botox) and dermal fillers, has climbed steadily since 2019, with private-equity acquisitions growing approximately 30 percent a year from 2019 to 2021. Senior partners <a href="/our-people/olivier-leclerc">Olivier Leclerc</a>, <a href="/our-people/nils-peters">Nils Peters</a>, and coauthor point to manufacturer innovations and an increasingly diverse consumer base as reasons to expect continuing resilience. Analysis suggests <a href="/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/here-to-stay-an-attractive-future-for-medical-aesthetics">the market for medical aesthetics is potentially underserved</a>, as many consumers say they plan to try a medical-aesthetics product in coming years. </p>
<p>Further notable analysis from McKinsey:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Senior partner <a href="/our-people/ondrej-burkacky">Ondrej Burkacky</a> and coauthors detail ways for <a href="/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/how-semiconductor-companies-can-fill-the-expanding-talent-gap">semiconductor companies to secure the new talent</a> that will be necessary to meet the growing demand for chips. An aging workforce is making the attraction and retention of new talent a top strategic objective.   </li>
    <li>Senior partners <a href="/our-people/curt-mueller">Curt Mueller</a>, <a href="/our-people/nicolai-muller">Nicolai Müller</a>, and coauthor suggest that companies could view <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/operations-blog/generative-ai-will-first-be-successfully-scaled-in-business-operations">operations functions as a useful testing ground for the introduction of generative AI (gen AI)</a>, in part because these functions often have well-established measurement and reporting processes that could make experiments with gen AI easier to assess.   </li>
    <li>Dipak Golechha, CFO of the cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks, spoke with McKinsey CFO and senior partner <a href="/our-people/eric-kutcher">Eric Kutcher</a> about <a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/palo-alto-networks-cfo-on-ai-cybersecurity-and-the-finance-leaders-mandate">CFOs’ capacity to approach strategic decisions from a unique perspective</a>.

<h4>What challenges and opportunities await private markets in 2024? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week<strong>’</strong>s </strong>headline findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Organizations can explore <a href="/industries/private-capital/our-insights/ten-considerations-for-private-markets-in-2024">ten considerations as private markets gear up for 2024</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Private markets</em>  face another year filled with uncertainty. Fundraising and overall deal volume were slow in 2023 and might see only modest growth in 2024. Amid this context, senior partners <a href="/our-people/fredrik-dahlqvist">Fredrik Dahlqvist</a>, <a href="/our-people/alastair-green">Alastair Green</a>, <a href="/our-people/david-quigley">David Quigley</a>, and coauthors identify <a href="/industries/private-capital/our-insights/ten-considerations-for-private-markets-in-2024">ten considerations for private-market decision makers</a>. The authors suggest that larger funds could continue to be in favor, infrastructure investing could accelerate, and real estate deal volume could ramp back up. </p>
<p><em>Individual US states </em>could play a vital role in America’s decarbonization efforts. States should consider how to access and use national subsidies to <a href="/industries/public-sector/our-insights/how-us-states-can-advance-a-successful-clean-energy-transition">help advance an orderly energy transition</a>. Senior partner <a href="/our-people/adi-kumar">Adi Kumar</a> and coauthors propose that state-level leaders can look for ways to convene public and private sector stakeholders, develop integrated energy transition plans, coordinate infrastructure projects, and catalyze the development, adoption, and scaling of climate technologies.</p>
<p><em>Semiconductor demand </em>is expected to keep growing. Senior partners <a href="/our-people/ondrej-burkacky">Ondrej Burkacky</a>, <a href="/our-people/matteo-mancini">Matteo Mancini</a>, <a href="/our-people/mark-patel">Mark Patel</a>, and coauthors submit that, to meet this increased demand, <a href="/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/exploring-new-regions-the-greenfield-opportunity-in-semiconductors">semiconductor manufacturers could expand operations into new regions</a>. In exploring this greenfield opportunity, manufacturers should look for locations that are secure enough to minimize supply chain risks, have access to plentiful renewable resources, and can potentially benefit from government-sponsored subsidies.</p>

<h4>Could closing the women&#x27;s health gap improve the global economy? Our weekly digest explores that topic and more.</h4>
<p><strong>This week<strong>’s </strong></strong>headline findings<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Closing the <a href="/mhi/our-insights/closing-the-womens-health-gap-a-1-trillion-dollar-opportunity-to-improve-lives-and-economies">women’s health gap</a> could provide a $1 trillion boost to the global economy.</li>
    <li>Banking leaders at Davos <a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/banking-matters-in-2024-a-live-take-from-the-wef">assessed an uncertain environment</a>.</li>
    <li>US wealth managers <a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/us-wealth-management-amid-market-turbulence-an-industry-converges">face a turbulent marketplace</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Women spend </em>25 percent more time in poor health than men, and more than half of this gap occurs during women’s working years. Expanding research into women’s health issues could improve lives while also boosting productivity. In a <a href="/mhi/our-insights/closing-the-womens-health-gap-a-1-trillion-dollar-opportunity-to-improve-lives-and-economies">new report from the McKinsey Health Institute</a>, senior partners <a href="/our-people/kweilin-ellingrud">Kweilin Ellingrud</a>, <a href="/our-people/lucy-perez">Lucy Pérez</a>, and their coauthors say that for every $1 invested in women’s health—including funding to address medical conditions that disproportionately affect women—$3 in economic value could be created. The impact on the global economy could equate to at least $1 trillion annually by 2040.  </p>
<p><em>In a Davos debriefing, </em>senior partner <a href="/our-people/ishaan-seth">Ishaan Seth</a> recaps <a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/banking-matters-in-2024-a-live-take-from-the-wef">banking-related themes that emerged from the recently wrapped World Economic Forum Annual Meeting</a>. Generative AI (gen AI) was not a major topic at last year’s event, but this year, it was nearly impossible to have a conversation that didn’t touch on its implications. Ensuring preparedness for “crucible moments”—pivotal decision points that can make or break a company—is also claiming an increasing share of business leaders’ attention amid the current context of uncertainty. And while Davos delegates were largely hopeful about the possibility of an economic soft landing and pleasantly surprised at the ongoing resilience of consumer spending, banking leaders (who are acutely aware that consumer savings have become heavily depleted over the past year) still see a macroeconomic picture marked by fragility. </p>
<p><em>The shifting</em> macroeconomic landscape could create <a href="/industries/financial-services/our-insights/us-wealth-management-amid-market-turbulence-an-industry-converges">intensifying competition within the wealth management industry in the United States</a>. Many wealth managers are implementing more affordable client acquisition strategies, such as direct-to-consumer marketing. Meanwhile, clients are increasingly seeking one-stop-shop solutions. Senior partners <a href="/our-people/jonathan-godsall">Jonathan Godsall</a>, <a href="/our-people/jill-zucker">Jill Zucker</a>, and coauthors say that wealth managers could reposition their franchises by pursuing strategies such as expanding their offerings, leveraging gen AI capabilities, and reallocating resources to highest-conviction priorities.</p>

Among them: innovators dominate headlines, but only those that scale a technology can dominate markets (more than 40 percent of digital and AI transformations stall out at the scaling phase); well-implemented digital solutions compound competitive advantages (the distance between digital AI leaders and their competitors has increased by 60 percent over the past three years); and—as simple as it sounds, it’s sometimes overlooked—the ultimate purpose of new digital initiatives is to build value (organizations that lead successful transformations deliver, on average, 2.7 times the value they initially expected). </p>
<p><em>Regulatory bodies</em> are weighing possible policies governing the use of AI and gen AI. Concerns involve issues such as intellectual property infringement, privacy violations, and the spread of misinformation. Senior partner <a href="/our-people/daniel-mikkelsen">Daniel Mikkelsen</a> and coauthors say <a href="/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/as-gen-ai-advances-regulators-and-risk-functions-rush-to-keep-pace">organizations should prepare now by self-regulating</a> to avoid potential legal, financial, and reputational risks. Among the no-regrets actions that organizations can take today: create transparency on AI and gen AI usage, implement governance structures that ensure oversight and accountability, and educate users about their individual rights.  </p>
<p><em>When a CEO </em>prepares to exit the role, the moment is fraught with risks for both the executive and the organization. Finding the right time can be difficult, as many CEOs feel they can’t leave when times are tough but don’t want to leave when things are going great. In an appearance on McKinsey’s <em>Inside the Strategy Room</em> podcast, senior partners <a href="/our-people/carolyn-dewar">Carolyn Dewar</a>, <a href="/our-people/kurt-strovink">Kurt Strovink</a>, and partner <a href="/our-people/blair-epstein">Blair Epstein</a> say <a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-to-transition-out-of-the-ceo-role">CEOs should prepare for their successions</a> (in consultation with their boards) from day one, ensure their potential successors receive proper leadership development and experience, and err on the side of leaving too early instead of too late. After the transition happens, former CEOs should get out of the way (and consider taking some time off before diving into anything else). </p>

Investors trust members of the US-based Magnificent Seven (among them, Apple and Nvidia) or of Europe\u0026rsquo;s Granolas (among them, Nestl\u0026eacute; and Novartis). Why? Those companies possess at least one distinguishing institutional capability\u0026mdash;a superpower\u0026mdash;derived from a winning combination of people, processes, and technology, write senior partners \u003ca href=\"/our-people/brad-mendelson\"\u003eBrad Mendelson\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/our-people/harald-fanderl\"\u003eHarald Fanderl\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/our-people/homayoun-hatami\"\u003eHomayoun Hatami\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"/our-people/liz-hilton-segel\"\u003eLiz Hilton Segel\u003c/a\u003e. Expanding on that concept, the authors have developed the VECTOR framework: vision, employees, culture, technology, organizational structure, and routines. A recent McKinsey survey found that \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/building-a-superpower-what-can-we-learn-from-the-magnificent-seven\"\u003ecompanies incorporating one or more VECTOR elements in their transformation efforts are more likely than others to report outperforming their peers\u003c/a\u003e. Companies seeking similar results, the authors note, can draw lessons from stock market darlings such as LVMH, which bakes quality into the long-term visions of its 75 brands; Nestl\u0026eacute;, which encourages an entrepreneurial culture that has produced consumer hits (such as Nespresso and Nesquik); and Amazon, whose organizational model of the \u0026ldquo;single-threaded leader\u0026rdquo; (a manager focused on a single initiative) is credited for the development of the Kindle e-reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen constitute half of the population and the workforce\u003c/em\u003e and often manage their families\u0026rsquo; medical care. Yet society has failed to prioritize theirs, which has led to a persistent gender health gap. In the United States, that disparity is largely driven by disproportionate outcomes in cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affects more than 60 million women and claims more of their lives than any other factor does. Cardiovascular disease presents in women differently from in men, yet sex- and gender-appropriate cardiac care and research remain insufficient. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that \u003ca href=\"/mhi/our-insights/the-state-of-us-womens-heart-health-a-path-to-improved-health-and-financial-outcomes\"\u003eover half of pregnancy-related deaths occur in the year after childbirth, yet up to 40 percent of women don\u0026rsquo;t access postpartum care\u003c/a\u003e.

To achieve that goal, the authors recommend a series of actions, including increasing sex-specific clinical research, raising public awareness, tailoring prevention strategies across women's lifespans, and improving the collection methods of women-specific data, such as menstrual cycle information, which the US National Institutes of Health calls the \u0026ldquo;fifth vital sign.\u0026rdquo; Such data are critical to developing more accurate diagnostics and treatment algorithms for women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther notable analysis from McKinsey:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003ePartners \u003ca href=\"/our-people/anutosh-banerjee\"\u003eAnutosh Banerjee\u003c/a\u003e, Julian Sevillano, and \u003ca href=\"/our-people/matt-higginson\"\u003eMatt Higginson\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and coauthors examine how tokenization\u0026mdash;creating digital asset representations on a blockchain\u0026mdash;ushers in the future of financial services.
