The UK-based HSBC had a market capitalization of roughly 156.17 billion U.S. dollars, by far the highest value in Europe. UBS ranked second, with a market cap of 99.9 billion U.S. dollars. Despite some fluctuations during the last decade, HSBC has continuously maintained the highest market cap among the largest European banks. \nWhat is market capitalization?\nMarket capitalization, which is often used as a measurement of a company’s size, is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the cost of one share. Market capitalization is an important metric for investors as it is simple to calculate and is also a good indicator for risk assessment. There are, however, many ways to measure the success of European banks, such as by total assets, revenue, or cost-to-income ratio (CIR), just to name a few. \nEuropean banks fall short globally\nOn a global scale, HSBC was the only European bank listed among the 15 largest banks worldwide as of December 2023. The U.S.-based bank JPMorgan Chase topped the worldwide ranking, with a market capitalization of over 491 billion U.S. dollars.\",\n                        \"url\": \"https://www.statista.com/statistics/382818/leading-banks-in-europe-by-market-capitalization/\",\n                        \"keywords\": [\"banking brand\",\"market capitalization\",\"banking\",\"Europe\"],\n                        \"temporalCoverage\": \"December 31, 2023\",\n                        \"spatialCoverage\": \"Europe\",\n                        \"creator\": {\n                            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                            \"url\": \"https://www.statista.com\",\n                            \"name\": \"Statista\",\n                            \"logo\": {\n                                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                                \"url\": \"https://cdn.statcdn.com/static/img/Statista-Logo.png\"\n                            }\n                        },\n                            \"includedInDataCatalog\": {\n                                \"@type\": \"DataCatalog\",\n                                \"url\": \"https://www.statista.com/topics/3426/banking-sector-in-europe/\",\n                                \"name\": \"Banking industry in Europe\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                ]\n            }\n                    \n                                                                                                                                                \n                    \n                                                            ,{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n    \"itemListElement\":\n    [\n            {\n            \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n            \"position\": 1,\n            \"item\": {\n                                    \"@id\": \"https://www.statista.com/markets/414/finance-insurance/\",\n                                \"name\": \"Finance &amp; Insurance\"\n            }\n        },\n            {\n            \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n            \"position\": 2,\n            \"item\": {\n                                    \"@id\": \"https://www.statista.com/markets/414/topic/993/financial-institutions/\",\n                                \"name\": \"Financial Institutions\"\n            }\n        }\n        ]\n}\n        ]\n    }\n            ]", "Finance & Insurance", "Financial Institutions", "Financial Institutions", "Mortgages & Financing", "Financial Institutions", "Leading financial advisors to M&A deals Europe biannual 2022-2023, by deal value", "Outstanding loans to non-financial corporations in the euro area 2020-2023", "Leading financial advisors to M&A deals Europe biannual 2022-2023, by deal value", "Outstanding loans to non-financial corporations in the euro area 2020-2023"], "analysis": [], "econom": ["Strategy and business building for the data-driven economy", "Renminbi deposits in all sectors of the United Kingdom (UK) economy Q1 2015 - Q2 2019", "Renminbi deposits in all sectors of the United Kingdom (UK) economy Q1 2015 - Q2 2019"]}},

Xiaomi has taken a tight grip on the third position, accounting for a market share of 14 in the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nSamsung and Apple smartphone sales \r\n\r\nSmartphone vendors have been suffering from the events of the past couple of years, including the pandemic and the economic downturn. However, they all appear to be recovering, as shown by the recent increase in shipments. For instance, mostly based on the main line of Galaxy Series, Samsung&#039;s smartphone shipments totaled nearly 226.5 million units globally in 2023.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNext to Samsung, Apple is a major manufacturer of smartphones worldwide, with  the company shipping more than  232 million iPhones worldwide in 2023 - a number that made Apple leading smartphone vendor for the first time ever. Apple’s sales tend to be very cyclical, peaking in the fourth quarter each year, much like in the fourth quarter of 2023, when they took the first spot in terms of units shipped globally with around 80.5 units.\r\n\r\n Huawei falls outside the leading five vendors  \r\n\r\nWhile Apple and Samsung are typically the two major companies challenging for the top spot, Huawei had provided a strong challenge in recent years. Particularly, the Chinese company managed to climb the smartphone market ladder between 2011 and 2020, recording shipments of over 32 million smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, strong performances from rivals like Xiaomi and the effects of the U.S. trade ban have since seen Huawei fall outside the list of top five vendors by smartphone shipments. \",\n                        \"url\": \"https://www.statista.com/statistics/271496/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-vendors-since-4th-quarter-2009/\",\n                        \"keywords\": [\"smartphone vendors\",\"smartphone\"],\n                        \"temporalCoverage\": \"Q4 2009 to Q1 2024\",\n                        \"spatialCoverage\": \"Worldwide\",\n                        \"creator\": {\n                            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                            \"url\": \"https://www.statista.com\",\n                            \"name\": \"Statista\",\n                            \"logo\": {\n                                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                                \"url\": \"https://cdn.statcdn.com/static/img/Statista-Logo.png\"\n                            }\n                        }}\n                ]\n            }\n                    \n                                                                                                                                    \n                    \n                                                            ,{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n    \"itemListElement\":\n    [\n            {\n            \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n            \"position\": 1,\n            \"item\": {\n                                    \"@id\": \"https://www.statista.com/markets/418/technology-telecommunications/\",\n                                \"name\": \"Technology &amp; Telecommunications\"\n            }\n        },\n            {\n            \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n            \"position\": 2,\n            \"item\": {\n                                    \"@id\": \"https://www.statista.com/markets/418/topic/481/telecommunications/\",\n                                \"name\": \"Telecommunications\"\n            }\n        }\n        ]\n}\n        ]\n    }\n            ]", "Quarterly smartphone market share worldwide by vendor 2009-2024", "Global market share held by smartphone operating systems 2009-2018, by quarter", "Industries & Markets", "Industry & Market reports", "Industry and market insights and forecasts", "Market Insights", "Market forecast and expert KPIs for 1000+ markets in 190+ countries & territories", "Explore Market Insights", "Detailed information for 39,000+ online stores and marketplaces", "Statista+ offers additional, data-driven services, tailored to your specific needs.
