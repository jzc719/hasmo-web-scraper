Youth is the country's hope and future. Youth exchanges are a fantastic way to energize and vitalize cross-Straits relations' peaceful and integrated development, whether for short-term visits or long-term settlements. In 2023, former chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Ma Ying-jeou led a delegation to the mainland to pay homage to his ancestors. He initiated an exchange between the young people of the island of Taiwan and mainland, promoting friendship between them. Subsequently, at Ma's invitation, teachers and students from five mainland colleges and universities visited Taiwan. In 2024, Ma again led a delegation of youth to the mainland for visits and exchanges in Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Beijing. Upon meeting again after an extended period, the young people reunited with former friends and acquaintances, smiling and exchanging greetings. Ma also extended another invitation to mainland students to visit Taiwan. Over the past year, young people from both sides of the Taiwan Straits have traveled back and forth. Their friendship has further mellowed and matured, becoming integrated into the bond between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. Bill Lin, a Taipei resident who came to the mainland in 2000, started his own technology company in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province because he found that virtual technology and applications were developing rapidly in the city and there was a great demand from European customers. He settled in the city because Shenzhen has a fantastic development environment with its support policies, resources, and services. Having worked in Shenzhen for many years and accumulating rich experience, he is now considering supporting more young people to fulfill more social responsibility. \"I think it's a great option for young Taiwan people to come to the mainland for development because we share the same culture, and it's easier for them to adapt when they come over,\" said Lin. He has been encouraging university students on the island of Taiwan to make use of their summer and winter holidays to do internships in the mainland. \"I love working and living here. I've taken to it like a duck to water,\" Liao Chengmao, a teacher from Taiwan at Xi'an Jiaotong University in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, said, noting that his more than 10 years of study and work in the mainland have given him a sense of accomplishment. In his spare time, Liao enjoys his life in Xi'an. He is fond of exploring shops, tasting food, visiting beautiful scenery and various museums to feel the history and immerse himself in local customs. He is fond of sharing the stories of his work and life in the mainland with family and friends in Taiwan. He hopes that through what he has seen and heard, he can help improve mutual understanding. The advancement of cross-Straits youth exchanges is of significant importance. Firstly, it facilitates the inheritance and promotion of traditional Chinese culture, enhancing the Chinese nation's sense of identity and belonging. Through common inheritance, historical review, and discussions on future development, young people can collectively appreciate the charm of Chinese culture, thereby strengthening the spiritual bond between them. Secondly, it enhances social cohesion and centripetal force. The intercollegiate exchange program and joint participation in various forms of exchange, such as academic activities, facilitate the formation of shared values and a sense of common ground between youth on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. This, in turn, contributes to strengthening social cohesion and forming a unified identity. For instance, since 2009, Renmin University and the National Chengchi University have collaborated to organize the \"Cross-Straits Forum on Frontier Issues in Finance and Economics.\" Dedicated to advancing Chinese modernization with tangible outcomes, this forum, held every other year in Beijing and Taipei, has facilitated cross-Straits cultural exchanges and further deepened cooperative research. Thirdly, it promotes economic cooperation and integrated development. Through youth entrepreneurship forums and economic trade fairs, cross-Straits youth can work together to identify potential avenues for collaboration, enhance mutual trust, and improve cross-Straits economic cooperation and integrated development. Furthermore, it fosters the growth of future leaders and talented communicators with vision and courage who can inject new vitality into the future development of cross-Straits relations. While pursuing their aspirations and fulfilling their social responsibilities, young people also realize the greater value of participating in cross-Straits integration and development. It is our hope that young people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits will learn from each other, collaborate, and contribute their strength to national rejuvenation.

These remarks were made by the Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China Tetsuro Homma in the preamble for the \"White Paper on the Chinese Economy and Japanese Companies.\" In preparing this white paper, opinions were solicited from 8,312 Japanese-affiliated companies that are members of the chamber. China offers significant market opportunities for foreign companies and is a powerful source of corporate profits for many companies that have set up operations in the country, the chamber said. According to the second survey on the perception of the economic and business environment by the chamber, regarding the amount of investment in China in 2023, of the 1,713 Japanese companies that answered, 15 percent of them plan to \"significantly increase\" or \"increase\" investment year-on-year. There were 38 percent of the surveyed companies said that their investment will be the same amount as in 2022. When asked how they see the Chinese market this year and beyond, 51 percent of the companies said that China is \"the most important market\" or \"one of the three most important markets.\" What also noteworthy is that less than 10 percent of the respondents said that they will downsize or withdraw investment, which the chamber said showing that the majority of Japanese companies have a strong commitment to remain firmly entrenched in the Chinese market. In the second survey, 54 percent of the surveyed companies were \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" with the business environment in China. There were 46 respondents wanting to see improvement or very much improvement, the survey said, noting that there is still plenty of room for improvement in the business environment, as they expressed their desire for visa-free travel to resume among some other issues. Osamu Onodera, a vice chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China, said that China is very important for foreign-funded enterprises, and at the same time, the existence of foreign-funded enterprises in China is also very important, noting that \"We hope that both parties can form a win-win relationship,\" which is also the main reason for conducting and releasing such white paper. External factors have caused challenges to Japanese companies doing businesses in China. Homma said on Wednesday that the impact of economic and trade frictions between the US and China has brought greater uncertainty to Japanese companies when making major decisions.

These measures are being added to China's ongoing efforts to expand visa-free policies and streamline entry procedures for inbound tourism, aimed at accelerating the country's high-level opening-up to shore up the comprehensive economic revival, analysts said. Foreign tourists' enthusiasm for visiting China has surged. According to a report sent by Tongcheng Travel to the Global Times, the number of foreign visitors to some domestic tourist cities has increased significantly during the peak summer travel season. The robust demand has greatly boosted hotel bookings and tourist spending in major cities. In the first half of this year, foreign bookings for various branded hotels on the eLong hotel-booking platform nearly doubled year-on-year. Hotel bookings by foreign guests are expected to continue growing momentum during the summer, according to the report. China has implemented measures to revive inbound tourism after the COVID-19 pandemic. In June, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a unilateral 15-day visa-free entry pilot for New Zealand, Australia and Poland, increasing eligible countries for the policy to 15 days since November 2023. Experts note that the further relaxation of entry restrictions will provide a significant boost to both domestic and international tourism markets. The strength of China's tourism reflects higher household incomes, service innovation and a shift towards visceral and cultural experiences in line with consumer preferences, UBS' Chief Investment Office said recently, highlighting tourism as a key driver of China's consumption upgrade and high-quality development. A series of inbound facilitation policies have spurred a consumption recovery across China's tourism market, drawing a large influx of foreign visitors recently, Zhang Lingyun, executive editor-in-chief of Tourism Tribune, told Global Times on Wednesday, noting the surge will stimulate domestic consumption. \"Regarding the market structure, international markets beyond neighboring countries are still ripe for development, holding significant potential for further growth in China's inbound tourism,\" Zhang said, calling industries to evolve their marketing approaches based on the characteristics of customer groups from different countries. Data from the National Immigration Administration showed that in the first half of the year, foreigners entered China through various ports amounted to 14.635 million in terms of passenger trips, up 152.7 percent year-on-year. Among them, 8.542 million entered visa-free, constituting 52 percent of the total and up 190.1 percent year-on-year. Chinese airlines are also ramping up international flight capacity in response to high demand. Air China's routes will exceed 90 percent of the 2019 levels this summer, totaling 114 routes across 43 countries and regions worldwide. This includes 32 routes with 53 daily flights between China and Europe, surpassing overall flight operations to 116 percent of the 2019 levels. China's National Development and Reform Commission and other departments have recently issued measures that called for the continuous optimization of entry and exit policies, the expansion of visa-free transit policies, an increase in the frequency of entry flights, and the introduction of more high-quality inbound tourism products and services to create new consumer options, while cultivating new growth points.", "Foreign tourists enjoy the scenery on a bamboo raft on Yulong River in Yangshuo county, Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, on July 15, 2023.

During round-table discussions analyzing the tradition and modernity of the civilizations of India and China, they explored Asian civilization and a community with a shared future for mankind. Professor Yu Longyu told the Global Times that there are five major reasons to propose the concept of harmonious coexistence between China and India, or CHINDIA. Yu said China and India's choice of peaceful development is fundamentally in line with philosophy. Their friendly exchanges have proven the feasibility of the concept of CHINDIA. In modern times, the sages and philosophers of China and India warned us that China and India must seek coexistence, Yu pointed out. Tagore scholar and Chinese professor Dong Youchen, who is also former deputy director-general of the Department of Culture and History of the National Academy of Governance, echoed Yu's point of view. \"It was India that had to provide Britain with a lot of wealth for more than 100 years. When I look back intently on the achievements of the civilized world, I cannot comprehend how the ideals of humanity could have been so tragically perverted in the name of civilization. Finally, I perceive that this perversion exposes the infinite indifference and contempt of some countries for the hundreds of millions of people in other countries.\" \"With the rock of British civilization on its chest, India has fallen into the predicament of stagnation. To make huge profits, Britain used opium to poison an ancient civilization as vast as China and seize part of China's land,\" Dong added, quoting Tagore's words. The development trend of the times requires China and India to unite and take on the heavy responsibility of turning the world around, said Yu. During a group discussion, Sabaree Mitra, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, told the Global Times that China and India need to develop new platforms to build an Asian civilization based on inclusiveness. \"China's cultural self-confidence shows that the country values traditional culture, rather than challenging other's cultures,\" she noted. Li Li, vice dean and research fellow of the Institute of International Relations in Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that the significance of the cultural exchanges between China and India include improving mutual understanding and trust and fostering the development of human civilization. Meanwhile, cultural exchanges could be a starting point for both countries to solve common problems such as education, healthcare, poverty alleviation and job creation. Talking about how to enhance cultural exchanges, Li pointed out that it is necessary that both sides focus on communication between youth. \"The decision makers need to abandon geopolitics, provide more channels, and create more favorable conditions for cultural exchanges through means such as visa issuance and transportation,\" Li noted. During the group discussion, an expert pointed out there are currently no direct flights between the two countries. Qiu Yonghui, deputy director, chief expert and a professor of the China Center for South Asian Studies of Sichuan University, told the Global Times that both countries need to seek common ground while respecting differences through people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. \"As two ancient civilizations, people-to-people exchanges between China and India have played a vital role in spreading civilization and culture,\" she said. \"When we are in a difficult situation, the exchanges between our peoples should not be interrupted, rather, they need to be enhanced in all aspects such as culture, sports, academic research and think tanks,\" Qiu suggested. While analyzing the similarity between the civilizations of China and India, Sun Jing, a research fellow at the Research Office of Oriental Philosophy under the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times, \"There are great similarities between Chinese civilization and Indian civilization, and the similarities in thinking make the two countries very similar in how they deal with various issues, which makes it convenient for us to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\" With scholars reaching a consensus during the one-day dialogue, experts are confident in stepping up efforts in building a new global civilization. \"Chinese and Indian people should jointly construct a new global civilization and make their own unique contributions, in which there will inevitably be an important position for Chinese culture and Indian culture,\" Qiu stressed."], "report": [], "industry": []}},

A game \"pilgrimage\" often refers to game enthusiasts visiting the real-world locations that inspired their favorite works, with these sites being referred to as \"holy lands.\" Today, as many Chinese games gain popularity overseas, they are also driving a trend of pilgrimages among international gamers. A month ago, pilgrimage videos of a Chinese game Genshin Impact went viral on major video sharing platforms, receiving numerous positive reviews and promoting various Chinese scenic spots. In one such video, German blogger Mikado first showcased some gameplay footage before transitioning to a shot of himself in a real-life location in China that resembles the game's scenes. This video has received over 700,000 views. \"As a player and fan of the Chinese game Genshin Impact , I often saw travel recommendations for this game on various video platforms. To learn more about the culture and stories behind the game, I registered an account on BiliBili (the Chinese equivalent of YouTube). My friends and I discovered potential real-world locations in China that served as the game's inspiration,\" Mikado told Global Times. \"Through these video platforms, I planned a detailed route for a game pilgrimage in China and posted videos along the way.

His fascination with Chinese games led him to major in Chinese language and history alongside East Asian art history at university. \"When I first started playing Genshin Impact , I noticed the game's landscapes were strikingly similar to real-world sites, such as the Huaguang Stone Forest in the game to Zhangjiajie, the Luhua Pool to Huanglong, and the Verdant Canyon to Yangshuo. ­After researching on YouTube, BiliBili, and Genshin forums, I learned that several locations in the game are based on real places in China,\" Mikado said. \"This information sparked my desire to visit China, not only to see these incredible landscapes in person but also to gain inspiration for my Chinese art studies, particularly in flower, mountain, and bamboo styles.\" Mikado noted that Huanglong and Guilin most closely resemble the environments in Genshin Impact . Parts of Zhangjiajie and Jiuzhaigou also share similarities. Visiting these places was one of his most memorable experiences. \"I was particularly impressed with the well-organized national parks and environmental awareness in China, balancing nature conservation with visitor access. Europe doesn't have landscapes like Zhangjiajie, Huanglong or Yangshuo. Although we have stunning scenery like the Swiss Alps in Europe, the diversity and uniqueness of Chinese landscapes is unparalleled,\" Mikado noted. Activities like bamboo rafting, which also appear in Genshin Impact , further enriched his experience and understanding of the region. However, the trip was more about cultural exchange and experiences. \"Sichuan opera and exquisite cuisines, including hotpot and sweet water noodles, offer flavors I could never find in Europe. Geographically, the limestone karst landscapes around Guilin and Yangshuo create some of the most breathtaking scenery I've ever seen. These unique formations have significantly influenced the local culture and the way of life.\" According to the \"2023 China Game Overseas Development Report\" released at China Game Industry Annual Conference, Chinese game companies have normalized their overseas operations in surrounding regions, with their presence in North American and European markets gradually increasing. Wider dissemination Many gaming forums and video platforms feature numerous recommendations for real-world locations that correspond to game scenes. This content provides players with more in-depth and meaningful information for planning their game pilgrimage trips. The dissemination of Chinese games overseas isn't limited to video platforms. In major cities, popular areas, public transportation, and large sports events worldwide, Chinese game companies frequently place billboards. For example, Chinese games like Genshin Impact , Rise of Kingdoms , and AFK Arena have placed ads in New York's Times Square, capturing the attention of many global players. \"I was pleasantly surprised and felt a sense of familiarity when I saw ads for Chinese games that I often play in Japanese subway stations and anime conventions,\" Wang Haoran, a Chinese student studying in Japan, told Global Times. \"Recently, I've noticed a significant increase in Japanese friends playing Chinese games. \"The Chinese game Onmyoji , which is based on ancient Chinese mythology and folklore, was also very popular in Japan at one time. Two of my classmates even visited China to pilgrimage the locations depicted in the game, to learn more about traditional Chinese culture and myths,\" Wang said. Likewise, Mikado's pilgrimage trip is far from over. \"I plan to visit Chengdu to see the pandas and celebrate the Lantern Festival in Zigong. My travel itinerary includes taking a train from Guangzhou to Guilin, then a boat to Yangshuo. I've researched various options, such as hiring a driver for transportation.

Photo: A screenshot of cosmetic brand Catkin's Tmall Platform A recent analysis report titled \"Why are South Korean products losing their luster in China?\" by The Korea Times has once topped the trending list on China's Sina Weibo, sparking heated discussions. The report said the South Korean wave in the early 2000s, sparked by the popularity of South Korean products ranging from skincare and cosmetics to fashion and food, began to cool off in 2016 in China and is now seeing a sharp decline. Official statistics show that South Korea's exports to China decreased by nearly 20 percent year-on-year in 2023. Huh En-jin, a visiting professor at Yonsei University, told The Korea Times that the sluggish export of South Korean products to China is due to Chinese consumers increasing preference for domestic products and related policies, according to the report. As of Tuesday afternoon, the hashtag \"Why South Korean style is no longer popular in China\" has been viewed about 67 million times, garnering more than 5,600 comments. Some users on Sina Weibo said that Chinese domestic brands now offer products good enough for daily use, while South Korean products lack unique characteristics that can't be replaced. \"When I was young, I did like the South Korean style, but as I grew up and learned about traditional Chinese clothing like hanfu and the horse-faced skirt, as well as various other facets of traditional culture, I realized that our country has an abundance of beautiful and excellent cultural heritage,\" read a Sina Weibo comment. With the ongoing rise of China-chic local brands, consumption among Chinese customers is subtly shifting. Taking cosmetics as an example, on one hand, South Korean products have been unable to innovate sufficiently to meet Chinese customers' changing demands. On the other hand, the rise of China-chic has made Chinese brands more appealing. Rita Bao, a market analyst from ChemLinked, told Global Times that Chinese consumers now have a deeper understanding of the ingredients and efficacy of beauty products. Core technology, effective ingredients, and targeted efficacy have become important criteria for product selection. For a long time, South Korean skincare brands have mainly promoted a natural skincare concept, often associated with keywords such as \"herbal,\" \"natural,\" and \"ginseng,\" with less emphasis on technology and efficacy. Consequently, their attractiveness to Chinese consumers has weakened, Bao said. In the past few years, Chinese domestic beauty brands have been developing competitive brands by promoting research, marketing, channels, and customer acquisition. Cosmetics companies have been actively increasing investment in research and development, empowering products and brands through the development of core ingredients and technology. According to a McKinsey research report in 2022, 49 percent of Chinese consumers say that the quality of domestic brands is better than foreign brands. The long-term impact on the market is much more complex. Chinese brands are fast rising with more effort being put into innovation and cultural marketing to resonate more with Chinese customers. More and more brands are drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese culture and Eastern aesthetics, integrating these unique elements into their products. Many domestic brands have been inspired by traditional Chinese culture, not only in packaging design, but also in ingredients and formulations. A lipstick with packaging featuring a traditional Chinese heart lock accessory, a powder patterned after a hairpin from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) … many cosmetics products are capitalizing on China-chic features. In today's consumer landscape in China, where purchasing beauty products is increasingly driven by rational considerations such as ingredients, formulation, and efficacy, the main consumer forces - the post-1990 generation and Generation Z - have a high appreciation for traditional culture, viewing China-chic as a trend and lifestyle. In summary, with the rise of Chinese domestic brands and changing consumer preferences, South Korean products face challenges in the Chinese market and need to innovate and adapt more effectively to regain consumer trust and appeal.

The report said the South Korean wave in the early 2000s, sparked by the popularity of South Korean products ranging from skincare and cosmetics to fashion and food, began to cool off in 2016 in China and is now seeing a sharp decline. Official statistics show that South Korea's exports to China decreased by nearly 20 percent year-on-year in 2023. Huh En-jin, a visiting professor at Yonsei University, told The Korea Times that the sluggish export of South Korean products to China is due to Chinese consumers increasing preference for domestic products and related policies, according to the report. As of Tuesday afternoon, the hashtag \"Why South Korean style is no longer popular in China\" has been viewed about 67 million times, garnering more than 5,600 comments. Some users on Sina Weibo said that Chinese domestic brands now offer products good enough for daily use, while South Korean products lack unique characteristics that can't be replaced. \"When I was young, I did like the South Korean style, but as I grew up and learned about traditional Chinese clothing like hanfu and the horse-faced skirt, as well as various other facets of traditional culture, I realized that our country has an abundance of beautiful and excellent cultural heritage,\" read a Sina Weibo comment. With the ongoing rise of China-chic local brands, consumption among Chinese customers is subtly shifting. Taking cosmetics as an example, on one hand, South Korean products have been unable to innovate sufficiently to meet Chinese customers' changing demands. On the other hand, the rise of China-chic has made Chinese brands more appealing. Rita Bao, a market analyst from ChemLinked, told Global Times that Chinese consumers now have a deeper understanding of the ingredients and efficacy of beauty products. Core technology, effective ingredients, and targeted efficacy have become important criteria for product selection. For a long time, South Korean skincare brands have mainly promoted a natural skincare concept, often associated with keywords such as \"herbal,\" \"natural,\" and \"ginseng,\" with less emphasis on technology and efficacy. Consequently, their attractiveness to Chinese consumers has weakened, Bao said. In the past few years, Chinese domestic beauty brands have been developing competitive brands by promoting research, marketing, channels, and customer acquisition. Cosmetics companies have been actively increasing investment in research and development, empowering products and brands through the development of core ingredients and technology. According to a McKinsey research report in 2022, 49 percent of Chinese consumers say that the quality of domestic brands is better than foreign brands.

{"url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202407/1315812.shtml", "data": {"market": ["The Ministry of Commerce Photo: VCG China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Wednesday launched a trade and investment barrier investigation into EU's related practices in its investigations of Chinese enterprises based on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR). Chinese experts said the move is aimed at protecting the legitimate interests of Chinese enterprises as well as upholding a form of true multilateralism for trade rules. They also urged the EU to stop its shortsighted behavior, as only a close cooperative relationship with China is the most beneficial long-term solution for the bloc's industrial development. According to the MOFCOM, it received on June 17 an application filed by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME), in which the applicant requested to conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the EU's investigations of Chinese enterprises. Measures investigated involve relevant practices adopted by the EU in investigations such as preliminary examinations, in-depth investigations and surprise inspections carried out targeting Chinese enterprises in accordance with the EU's FSR and the implementing rules. The application mainly involved products such as rolling stock, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment, the Chinese ministry said. According to related laws, the MOFCOM may use questionnaires, hearings, field investigations and other means to obtain information from stakeholders and conduct investigations. The probe shall be completed by January 10, 2025, and may be extended to April 10, 2025 under special circumstances, said the ministry. \"Launching the investigation is a move by Chinese authorities to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, as in some of the EU's so-called investigation and evidence collection process, we also see that Europe is now reflecting a stronger unilateralism, which violates the rules of the WTO,\" Cui Hongjian, a professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University's Academy of Regional and Global Governance, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Cui noted that currently, the EU has a series of practices that are constantly trying to break the international rules, whereas the MOFCOM action is truly upholding the rules of multilateralism in trade. The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU) in June said in a statement it shared with the Global Times that Chinese companies reported that the European side exceeded the scope of the FSR investigation. \"Despite the opposition of Chinese enterprises, the EU side copied documents containing information about the companies' key technology components, which are classified as commercial secrets.

Analysts said it signals that the country is making technological advances and there are bright prospects for the domestic AI sector. AI use by respondents from China has surged to 83 percent, according to the report by US AI and analytics software company SAS and Coleman Parkes Research. The survey targeted 1,600 decision makers across key global markets. The survey found upticks in generative AI use across the world, with the largest increases in China. To be specific, the adoption rate of generative AI in China was higher than in 16 other countries and regions, surpassing the US where only 65 percent of respondents reported using generative AI. The market size of AI-generated content in China’s e-commerce industry is projected to triple in 2024, reaching 1.2 billion yuan ($171.4 million). This significant increase demonstrates the growing importance and effectiveness of generative AI tools in enhancing brand sales and driving traffic for e-commerce brands, Wu Bin, CEO of infimind, a Beijing-based AI technology solutions provider in the fashion and e-commerce industry, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Yan Junjie, CEO of Shanghai-based emerging startup MiniMax, told the Global Times that the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) and enterprise data for developing custom generative AI applications will lead to significant growth in the market. The long-term prospects for generative AI are promising, Yan said. “As the cost of LLM services for enterprises continues to decrease, we can expect Chinese companies to increasingly embrace generative AI at a faster pace in the coming years,” Yan noted. A recent UN report showed that China topped the list for generative AI patent filings in the past decade. Industry insiders said all these signs indicate that China has surged ahead in the generative AI landscape. Generative AI has continued to transform multiple business sectors in China. As its adoption in various sectors accelerates, benefits from its application include reduced costs and increased revenue, observers said. In terms of specific industries, respondents working in TMT, retailing, insurance, banking and life sciences report the largest increase in generative AI use. Generative AI can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Some of the most common generative models in use today are large language models – like the one that powers ChatGPT, which is capable of creating language and text – and diffusion models, which create images and video. Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in November 2022, generative AI has come a long way. Leveraging its large market size and homegrown innovations, China has seen a number of generative AI applications emerge, including short video creation, e-commerce and education. For instance, in e-commerce and short video platforms, generative AI can offer exceptional levels of personalization and empower more dynamic and efficient content creation. Last week, a report by the UN's World Intellectual Property Organization showed China was leading the generative patent race, filing more than 38,000 between 2014 and 2023, against 6,276 filed by the US in the same period. The top patent applicants in China include TikTok owner ByteDance, Tencent, Ping An Insurance Group and Baidu. Generative AI is driving economic growth. A 2023 report from McKinsey estimates that generative AI is set to add up to $4.4 trillion of value to the global economy annually. This would increase the impact of AI by 15 to 40 percent. According to another recent report on China, McKinsey predicted that generative AI is expected to be a significant contributor to China’s economy, with the potential to add up to $2 trillion to GDP.

As its adoption in various sectors accelerates, benefits from its application include reduced costs and increased revenue, observers said. In terms of specific industries, respondents working in TMT, retailing, insurance, banking and life sciences report the largest increase in generative AI use. Generative AI can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Some of the most common generative models in use today are large language models – like the one that powers ChatGPT, which is capable of creating language and text – and diffusion models, which create images and video. Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in November 2022, generative AI has come a long way. Leveraging its large market size and homegrown innovations, China has seen a number of generative AI applications emerge, including short video creation, e-commerce and education. For instance, in e-commerce and short video platforms, generative AI can offer exceptional levels of personalization and empower more dynamic and efficient content creation.

Photo: Fan Anqi/GT The overall safety level of nuclear power in China ranks among the best in the world, and China is working on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and big data into the application of nuclear power plants to ensure safer and more reliable nuclear power operations, industry insiders said at a forum held in Beijing on Wednesday. Ye Qizhen, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said at the forum that China's operational nuclear units have maintained safe and stable operation, with no International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) level 2 or above operational incidents in the last 30 years. In 2023, there were no operational incidents of INES level 1 or above, placing China's operational safety level among the best in the world, Ye noted. The INES is a tool for communicating the safety significance of nuclear and radiological events to the public, developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Under the scale, events are rated on seven levels, with level 1 being a slight anomaly and level 7 rated as a major accident with widespread health and environmental effects, according to the IAEA website. Ye said the radiation levels around Chinese nuclear power plants have always remained low, without having any adverse environmental impacts. Meanwhile, the emissions from nuclear power plants are more than two orders of magnitude below the national standard limits. Neither occupational disease hazards nor cases of occupational overexposure have occurred. \"Nuclear safety is the lifeline of nuclear development and the key to ensuring a stable and successful implementation of our country's three-step nuclear energy development strategy,\" Liu Lu, deputy director of the National Nuclear Safety Administration, said as she delivered a speech at the forum. To better address the challenges, China is spearheading advancements in a number of innovations, including the development of accident tolerant fuels, and integrating cutting-edge technologies and robust safety protocols into its nuclear power industry. AI will play a pivotal role in enhancing nuclear safety and efficiency in China, industry insiders revealed at Wednesday's event. They said AI applications are being integrated into nuclear power plants to guide operator actions, optimize operational procedures, and facilitate rapid response to emergencies. This includes automated monitoring of critical systems and the deployment of robots for maintenance tasks in radiation-prone areas, significantly reducing human exposure. Additionally, China is harnessing big data to create comprehensive systems that consolidate operational data from multiple nuclear plants. This enables proactive management by identifying patterns and anomalies, thereby enhancing overall operational reliability and safety measures. Scholars at the forum also shared insights on the digital transformation of the nuclear power industry, which includes the implementation of intelligent operation control systems and advanced monitoring technologies. This involves leveraging image-based inspections and specialized robotics for surveillance and maintenance management, ensuring continuous and effective oversight of plant operations. Addressing environmental concerns, China is pioneering waste management solutions tailored to nuclear facilities. Researches are focusing on technologies to remove tritium from wastewater, ensuring minimal environmental impact. \"Nuclear power plants generate waste with 99 percent classified as low-to-intermediate level waste. High-level waste is managed through glass encapsulation, triple-engineered barriers, and burial at depths of 400-500 meters underground, strictly isolated from the biosphere,\" Ye elaborated. Previously in March, foreign media sources hyped that in 2022, Chinese nuclear power plants released wastewater containing tritium at levels up to nine times higher than the amount expected to be found in the planned annual discharge from Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi complex. Scholars at the seminar refuted such claims , noting that the treated wastewater China released and the radioactive water dumped by Japan is \"fundamentally different.\" They also told the Global Times that China has proposed to Japan a technology specifically designed for tritium wastewater treatment.

Photo: Fan Anqi/GT The overall safety level of nuclear power in China ranks among the best in the world, and China is working on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and big data into the application of nuclear power plants to ensure safer and more reliable nuclear power operations, industry insiders said at a forum held in Beijing on Wednesday. Ye Qizhen, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said at the forum that China's operational nuclear units have maintained safe and stable operation, with no International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) level 2 or above operational incidents in the last 30 years. In 2023, there were no operational incidents of INES level 1 or above, placing China's operational safety level among the best in the world, Ye noted. The INES is a tool for communicating the safety significance of nuclear and radiological events to the public, developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Under the scale, events are rated on seven levels, with level 1 being a slight anomaly and level 7 rated as a major accident with widespread health and environmental effects, according to the IAEA website. Ye said the radiation levels around Chinese nuclear power plants have always remained low, without having any adverse environmental impacts. Meanwhile, the emissions from nuclear power plants are more than two orders of magnitude below the national standard limits. Neither occupational disease hazards nor cases of occupational overexposure have occurred. \"Nuclear safety is the lifeline of nuclear development and the key to ensuring a stable and successful implementation of our country's three-step nuclear energy development strategy,\" Liu Lu, deputy director of the National Nuclear Safety Administration, said as she delivered a speech at the forum.

The Chinese yuan's share on Russia's foreign exchange market reached 99.6 percent in June, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. It marked a substantial increase from the previous month when the Chinese yuan accounted for just 53.6 percent of Russia's exchange trading volume. This is mainly because the latest sanctions introduced by the US in mid-June forced the Moscow Exchange to halt trading in US dollars and the euro, according to the report. It was not hard for US policymakers to foresee the potential consequences before imposing sanctions on Russia. As it stands, it was US sanctions that contributed to the de-dollarization of trade between China and Russia. With de-dollarization hype in the West ramping up, China must exercise caution toward the yuan's internationalization efforts to avoid geopolitical interpretation. In recent years, the progress of the yuan's internationalization has sparked concerns in the US regarding the potential de-dollarization effects of the currency. It is true that the US government has abused the dominant position of the US dollar within the international financial system to advance its geopolitical agenda, making the dollar increasingly resemble a political tool and causing many countries to promote de-dollarization to avoid potential geopolitical risks. But given the reality of international trade and investment landscape, the US dollar still remains the most important currency for trade settlement and investment, making it difficult to challenge its dominance in the short term. Of course, while there is no denying about the dominant position of the US dollar, the diversification of international currencies is still crucial for mitigating geopolitical risk of currencies. The yuan's internationalization can play a role in this, but it should not be overstated. Furthermore, as China pushes forward with the internationalization of the yuan, it is imperative to fully consider the intricate nature of the China-US economic and trade relations.

China's economic stability and growth, to a certain extent, is closely linked to the US dollar, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach on the issue.

In addition, a hasty push of the internationalization of the yuan may pose risks of volatility and instability in the financial markets. This is because rapidly expanding the use of the yuan in the international market may introduce new challenges to the management of China's foreign exchange reserves. Currently, China maintains substantial holdings of dollar reserves, which serve as a guarantee for the stability of the Chinese economy and its resilience against external threats. If other countries ditch the dollar too quickly, it could result in fluctuations in the valuation of dollar assets, placing strain on China's reserve management.

The background of this summit is the 75th anniversary of the founding of NATO. In order to demonstrate the continued relevance of this organization that should have disbanded after the Cold War, the US and NATO have boasted about NATO's \"glorious history\" and \"unity\" among its member states long before the summit began.

Due to the major reshuffle in US and European politics, \"it's hard not to wonder how the alliance will look a year from now - whether it will make it to 76 alive and well.\" NATO is the product of camp confrontation and group politics, and stands in the opposite of the general global trend as well as the aspiration of the people. No matter how hard it tries to present itself as a \"peacekeeping organization,\" it cannot hide its true nature as a \"war machine.\" NATO's so-called security comes at the expense of the security of other countries; many of the \"security anxieties\" peddled by NATO are created by the organization itself. We will not speculate on whether NATO \"will make it to 76 alive,\" but it is certain that NATO will not peacefully move into the future. It needs to continuously create more enemies and greater crises to sustain its existence. Not content with dividing Europe, NATO is also seeking to incite conflicts and confrontations in the Asia-Pacific region. Biden announced that the US will provide \"historic assistance\" to Ukraine along with its allies, including allocating $1 billion to strengthen Ukraine's air defense system. In addition, an official from the US Department of State said before the summit that \"some of China's threats\" will be reflected in the communique, which is just clichés. Now, providing assistance to Ukraine, increasing military spending, and hyping up the \"China threat\" are the three \"lifelines\" of NATO. NATO relies on these three lifelines to maintain a high level of strategic binding with the US, serving as a tool for the US to confront, control and suppress other countries. The so-called \"success\" and \"strength\" of NATO that the US and the bloc boast about today pose great danger to the world. All forces in the international community that love peace should remain vigilant against this dangerous trend. NATO's continued expansion in Europe and its reach into the Asia-Pacific region aim to infiltrate group politics and confrontational thinking into regional integration and economic globalization. If NATO is allowed to group all the world's problems, the entire world will inevitably become factionalized, divided, and confrontational, with the clouds of war becoming denser as NATO's functions strengthen, posing a very real threat. According to American media reports, most Americans are not interested in the NATO summit in Washington. Not caring is also an attitude that is probably representative in the Western world. The strengthening of NATO comes at the expense of the well-being of people in various countries, including those in the West. Look at Stoltenberg's latest \"celebratory\" speech, which boasted about how to arm and how to confront, without a single word about how to benefit the lives of ordinary Western people. He also boasted that defense spending accounting for 2 percent of GDP in member countries will become a bottom line in the future, which comes at the expense of social welfare and development resources of Western countries. If used for aid to developing countries, how much hunger and poverty can be solved. Now the US is shifting most conflicts in the world toward China, and NATO is also following suit to strengthen its competitive stance against China. This not only arouses opposition from countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but also complaints within European states. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, which holds the current rotating presidency of the EU Council, recently warned in the American magazine Newsweek that if NATO chooses conflict instead of cooperation, and war instead of peace, it will be committing suicide. If NATO continues to rely on its counter-trend approach to sustain existence, especially in pursuit of the bloc's \"globalization,\" its accelerated failure is inevitable."], "trend": ["Illutration: Liu Rui/GT The 2024 NATO Summit kicked off in Washington on July 9, local time.

Amid Taiwan Straits and South China Sea tensions, as well as the US-led RIMPAC 2024 exercise that blatantly targets China, Chinese naval activities, not aimed at any other country, serve to enhance combat capabilities and deter unstable security factors, experts said on Wednesday. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's aircraft carrier Shandong , the Type 055 large destroyer Yan'an , the Type 052D destroyer Guilin and the Type 054A Yuncheng were spotted sailing in the Philippine Sea on Tuesday, the news website of the US Naval Institute reported on the day, citing a news release from Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff. The Japanese news release said that the Shandong was observed conducting flight operations with its fighter aircraft and helicopters. The Chinese aircraft carrier group was spotted sailing in the South China Sea near the Philippines in June, and analysts said that the carrier likely sailed from the South China Sea via the Bashi Channel to the south of the island of Taiwan into the Philippine Sea in the West Pacific. A release by the defense authority on the island of Taiwan said that it spotted 37 PLA aircraft of various types around the island conducting air-sea joint training along with the carrier Shandong and other PLA Navy vessels on Wednesday. It marks the first time the Shandong has embarked on a far seas exercise beyond the first island chain this year, observers noted, further mentioning that they are looking forward to seeing if the carrier will make new breakthroughs in terms of training intensity, new tactics practiced and new locations reached. The aircraft carrier Shandong and its escorts are not the only PLA Navy warships currently operating in the West Pacific. Citing the Russian Pacific Fleet, Russian News Agency Tass reported on July 4 that the Russian corvette Sovershenny joined the PLA Navy's Type 052D destroyer Yinchuan , Type 054A frigate Hengshui and Type 903 replenishment ship Weishanhu at a designated meeting point to commence the fourth joint Russia-China maritime patrol in the Asia-Pacific region since 2021 to bolster naval cooperation and maintain peace and stability. The joint group is set to conduct anti-submarine and air defense drills and practice search and rescue measures at sea during their joint patrol, Tass reported. The China-Russia joint group was spotted entering the West Pacific from the East China Sea via the Osumi Strait from July 4 to 5, according to Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff. Additional PLA Navy warships, including the Type 055 large destroyer Lhasa , the Type 903A replenishment ship Kekexilihu , the Type 052D destroyer Kaifeng and Type 054A frigate Yantai , also entered the West Pacific by July 1. They first entered the Sea of Japan from the East China Sea via the Tsushima Strait, then entered the West Pacific via the Tsugaru Strait, two separate news releases by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said. China has yet to officially announce these naval activities. Observers wonder if there is a link between the aircraft carrier Shandong 's far seas exercise and the China-Russia joint patrol, reflecting on possible training objectives, and where the warships would travel to, considering the ongoing security tensions over the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue, and that the Chinese and Russian naval activities are coinciding with the US-led RIMPAC exercise being held around Hawaii Islands, with China believed to be set as an imaginary enemy. Zhang Junshe, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the China-Russia joint maritime patrol has become regular occurrence, and such activities can further consolidate the strategic mutual trust between the two countries and the two militaries. It is not impossible that the Shandong carrier group and the China-Russia joint group join force in the West Pacific waters to conduct mock confrontation drills or joint defense drills, Zhang said.

The Chinese drills combined with the China-Russia joint patrol are completely different from the US-led RIMPAC exercise, as they are not targeted at any other country. The RIMPAC, on the other hand, is obviously simulating a scenario in which the US militarily interferes in the Taiwan question in case of a conflict, analysts said. Another Chinese military expert, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Wednesday that while the PLA Navy's exercises and drills are prescheduled and are not related with the ongoing situations, they contribute to regional peace and stability by deterring unstable factors and provide strategic power balancing.

It is not impossible that the Shandong carrier group and the China-Russia joint group join force in the West Pacific waters to conduct mock confrontation drills or joint defense drills, Zhang said. In addition to traditional areas such as the East China Sea, the West Pacific and the North Pacific, it cannot be ruled out that the groups could sail to regions farther away, such as the East Pacific and South Pacific, which completely conforms to the international law and practices, Zhang said. The Chinese drills combined with the China-Russia joint patrol are completely different from the US-led RIMPAC exercise, as they are not targeted at any other country. The RIMPAC, on the other hand, is obviously simulating a scenario in which the US militarily interferes in the Taiwan question in case of a conflict, analysts said. Another Chinese military expert, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Wednesday that while the PLA Navy's exercises and drills are prescheduled and are not related with the ongoing situations, they contribute to regional peace and stability by deterring unstable factors and provide strategic power balancing. The goal of any exercise should be enhancing combat capabilities and safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and development interests, the expert said.", "J-15 fighter jets commence takeoffs from the aircraft carrier Shandong . Photo: Courtesy of Ding Zheng China's Shandong aircraft carrier group reportedly started its first far seas exercise of the year after it was spotted on Tuesday operating in the West Pacific, where another group of Chinese and Russian warships are conducting a joint maritime patrol. Amid Taiwan Straits and South China Sea tensions, as well as the US-led RIMPAC 2024 exercise that blatantly targets China, Chinese naval activities, not aimed at any other country, serve to enhance combat capabilities and deter unstable security factors, experts said on Wednesday. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's aircraft carrier Shandong , the Type 055 large destroyer Yan'an , the Type 052D destroyer Guilin and the Type 054A Yuncheng were spotted sailing in the Philippine Sea on Tuesday, the news website of the US Naval Institute reported on the day, citing a news release from Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff. The Japanese news release said that the Shandong was observed conducting flight operations with its fighter aircraft and helicopters. The Chinese aircraft carrier group was spotted sailing in the South China Sea near the Philippines in June, and analysts said that the carrier likely sailed from the South China Sea via the Bashi Channel to the south of the island of Taiwan into the Philippine Sea in the West Pacific. A release by the defense authority on the island of Taiwan said that it spotted 37 PLA aircraft of various types around the island conducting air-sea joint training along with the carrier Shandong and other PLA Navy vessels on Wednesday. It marks the first time the Shandong has embarked on a far seas exercise beyond the first island chain this year, observers noted, further mentioning that they are looking forward to seeing if the carrier will make new breakthroughs in terms of training intensity, new tactics practiced and new locations reached. The aircraft carrier Shandong and its escorts are not the only PLA Navy warships currently operating in the West Pacific. Citing the Russian Pacific Fleet, Russian News Agency Tass reported on July 4 that the Russian corvette Sovershenny joined the PLA Navy's Type 052D destroyer Yinchuan , Type 054A frigate Hengshui and Type 903 replenishment ship Weishanhu at a designated meeting point to commence the fourth joint Russia-China maritime patrol in the Asia-Pacific region since 2021 to bolster naval cooperation and maintain peace and stability. The joint group is set to conduct anti-submarine and air defense drills and practice search and rescue measures at sea during their joint patrol, Tass reported. The China-Russia joint group was spotted entering the West Pacific from the East China Sea via the Osumi Strait from July 4 to 5, according to Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff. Additional PLA Navy warships, including the Type 055 large destroyer Lhasa , the Type 903A replenishment ship Kekexilihu , the Type 052D destroyer Kaifeng and Type 054A frigate Yantai , also entered the West Pacific by July 1. They first entered the Sea of Japan from the East China Sea via the Tsushima Strait, then entered the West Pacific via the Tsugaru Strait, two separate news releases by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said. China has yet to officially announce these naval activities. Observers wonder if there is a link between the aircraft carrier Shandong 's far seas exercise and the China-Russia joint patrol, reflecting on possible training objectives, and where the warships would travel to, considering the ongoing security tensions over the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue, and that the Chinese and Russian naval activities are coinciding with the US-led RIMPAC exercise being held around Hawaii Islands, with China believed to be set as an imaginary enemy.

As the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of destroying coral reefs around Huangyan Dao due to \"illegal actions such as harvesting endangered giant clams\" in May, Chinese experts believe that Manila's move to shift blame to China in an attempt to pursue a new legal battle is doomed to be futile in light of the evidence and facts revealed in the report. From May to June, Chinese scientific researchers carried out an unprecedentedly large-scale on-site investigation to assess the ecological and environmental conditions in the Huangyan Dao area. This included evaluating seawater quality, marine sediment quality, biological quality, floating litter, as well as coral communities, reef-dwelling fish, and other typical biological groups, with the assistance of satellite remote sensing analysis. The results of the research revealed a good seawater and marine sediment quality, which was below-standard levels of pollutants, zero cyanide detected of seawater samples, an abundant distribution of giant clams, and a healthy state of the coral reef ecosystem. Experts noted that this scientific research shows that China's effective governance of Huangyan Dao has played a positive role in protecting the island's ecological environment. The scientific research ship in China's Huangyan Dao area Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment A harbor of corals Huangyan Dao located in the southeast of Zhongsha Qundao, serving as a key traditional fishing area and natural shelter in China. It is also a vital \"harbor\" for maintaining marine biodiversity in the South China Sea, holding substantial strategic and ecological significance. Since last year, some Philippine politicians and media have repeatedly hyped up the topic of falsely claiming that Chinese fishermen used cyanide to fish in waters off Huangyan Dao and deliberately destroyed the traditional fishing grounds of Philippine fishermen. However, according to the report, no cyanide, copper, lead, cadmium, total chromium, mercury, or arsenic were detected at any survey sites. In response to Global Times' question on whether it means there was no cyanide fishing in the area, Lin Kui, the deputy director of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment, confirmed the conclusion. During the more than 20 days of scientific research, the joint investigation team did not find fishermen illegally using cyanide for fishing, Lin stressed. He also cited published academic paper that Filipino fishermen have used cyanide to poison fish since 1930s, and even during the global pandemic years, there were still reports of Filipino fishermen using cyanide to poison fish at sea. \"We sincerely hope that countries around the South China Sea can stop using cyanide for fishing and other destructive fishing activities, and work together to protect the fragile ecosystem of the South China Sea,\" Lin said. Live coral reefs in the lagoon of Huangyan Dao Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment Results also show that it meets the water quality requirements for coral growth in the South China Sea. There are also no signs of seawater eutrophication. The hard coral communities were in healthy condition, while live coral cover in the northeast part of Huangyan Dao reached as high as 37.1 percent. This is comparable to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia that contains the world's largest collection of coral reefs, the report showed. The scientific research recorded 109 species of hard corals belonging to 34 genera and 12 families, marking the highest species diversity ever documented. The average hard coral cover reached 28.6 percent, higher than the survey results in 2015, with sufficient recruitment of juvenile corals. All the hard coral species were listed as national Class II protected wildlife in China. Among the hard corals in this survey, 41 species were classified as Near Threatened and 14 species as Vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List). The species diversity of coral communities was relatively high, as the survey recorded 125 species of coral reef fish from 23 families on-site. International scholars generally believe that global warming is the major reason behind the rapid degradation of coral reefs (coral bleaching) on a global scale. But hard coral communities near Huangyan Dao demonstrate strong resistance and a tolerance to rising sea temperatures, making the island a healthy habitat for corals and related species in the South China Sea. According to the survey results, the bleaching of hard corals in Huangyan Dao remained at a low level (below 1 percent). No coral disease was identified, and the coral mortality rates also remain low (below 1 percent). Since China began to exercise long-term effective administrative jurisdiction over Huangyan Dao, it has gradually repaired the marine pollution and ecological damage caused by previous destructive fishing by the Philippines in the area, Yang Xiao, deputy director of the Institute of Maritime Strategy Studies under the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. He noted that Huangyan Dao used to be a target range for the US military, and the coral reefs there have also been severely damaged by the remnants of shells for a long time. A giant clam discovered in Huangyan Dao area Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment It is worth noting that this survey revealed a rich distribution of giant clams in the lagoon of Huangyan Dao. Giant clams, the largest marine bivalve inhabiting coral reefs, is listed as key protected wildlife in China and is included in the IUCN Red List. The giant clams, as a reef-building organism, contributes to the formation and stabilization of coral reef frameworks, which is essential for the support of coral reef development and the maintenance of a balanced ecosystem Lin told the Global Times that since 2016, China has explicitly banned the sale and purchase of giant clams and their products. This regulation has been strictly enforced, and based on on-site observations, it is no longer possible for illegal digging and harvesting of giant clams to occur on Huangyan Island. The survey also recorded blue coral, fire coral, sea anemone, soft coral and other coral reef ecological communities. These organisms are not only an important component of reef biodiversity, but also a hot resource of the latest marine natural products and marine medicine. With diverse bioactive compounds, they have great potentials in the development of new drugs, cosmetics and healthy food.

The South China Sea summer fishing moratorium system, which was officially implemented in China since 1999, has been in effect for 25 years. This system not only demonstrates the Chinese government's commitment to protecting marine fishery resources, but also showcases China as a responsible global leader in safeguarding the marine ecological environment and promoting sustainable fisheries development. However, China's efforts are not always understood. The Philippines and the US have consistently promoted negative narratives targeting China, leveling accusations of environmental destruction in the South China Sea and hinting at possible court action against the country. In February, the Philippines claimed that Chinese fishermen were using cyanide at Huangyan Dao. However, Chinese marine experts have pointed out that the Philippines has, in fact, been using cyanide for fishing since 1962, and approximately 65 tons of cyanide are sprayed onto coral reefs each year, according to World Wildlife Fund. This severely damaged the marine ecology of the South China Sea. Additionally, in 2023, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) issued a report titled \"Environmental Threats to the South China Sea.\" In the report, the Center claims that \"increased fishing, dredging, and land fill, along with giant clam harvesting in recent decades have taken a devastating toll on thousands of species found nowhere else on earth.\" A Chinese researcher dives into the seabed to detect the ecosystem condition around Huangyan Dao.

In response to Global Times' question on whether it means there was no cyanide fishing in the area, Lin Kui, the deputy director of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment, confirmed the conclusion. During the more than 20 days of scientific research, the joint investigation team did not find fishermen illegally using cyanide for fishing, Lin stressed. He also cited published academic paper that Filipino fishermen have used cyanide to poison fish since 1930s, and even during the global pandemic years, there were still reports of Filipino fishermen using cyanide to poison fish at sea. \"We sincerely hope that countries around the South China Sea can stop using cyanide for fishing and other destructive fishing activities, and work together to protect the fragile ecosystem of the South China Sea,\" Lin said. Live coral reefs in the lagoon of Huangyan Dao Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment Results also show that it meets the water quality requirements for coral growth in the South China Sea. There are also no signs of seawater eutrophication. The hard coral communities were in healthy condition, while live coral cover in the northeast part of Huangyan Dao reached as high as 37.1 percent. This is comparable to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia that contains the world's largest collection of coral reefs, the report showed. The scientific research recorded 109 species of hard corals belonging to 34 genera and 12 families, marking the highest species diversity ever documented. The average hard coral cover reached 28.6 percent, higher than the survey results in 2015, with sufficient recruitment of juvenile corals. All the hard coral species were listed as national Class II protected wildlife in China. Among the hard corals in this survey, 41 species were classified as Near Threatened and 14 species as Vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List). The species diversity of coral communities was relatively high, as the survey recorded 125 species of coral reef fish from 23 families on-site. International scholars generally believe that global warming is the major reason behind the rapid degradation of coral reefs (coral bleaching) on a global scale. But hard coral communities near Huangyan Dao demonstrate strong resistance and a tolerance to rising sea temperatures, making the island a healthy habitat for corals and related species in the South China Sea. According to the survey results, the bleaching of hard corals in Huangyan Dao remained at a low level (below 1 percent). No coral disease was identified, and the coral mortality rates also remain low (below 1 percent). Since China began to exercise long-term effective administrative jurisdiction over Huangyan Dao, it has gradually repaired the marine pollution and ecological damage caused by previous destructive fishing by the Philippines in the area, Yang Xiao, deputy director of the Institute of Maritime Strategy Studies under the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. He noted that Huangyan Dao used to be a target range for the US military, and the coral reefs there have also been severely damaged by the remnants of shells for a long time. A giant clam discovered in Huangyan Dao area Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment It is worth noting that this survey revealed a rich distribution of giant clams in the lagoon of Huangyan Dao. Giant clams, the largest marine bivalve inhabiting coral reefs, is listed as key protected wildlife in China and is included in the IUCN Red List. The giant clams, as a reef-building organism, contributes to the formation and stabilization of coral reef frameworks, which is essential for the support of coral reef development and the maintenance of a balanced ecosystem Lin told the Global Times that since 2016, China has explicitly banned the sale and purchase of giant clams and their products. This regulation has been strictly enforced, and based on on-site observations, it is no longer possible for illegal digging and harvesting of giant clams to occur on Huangyan Island. The survey also recorded blue coral, fire coral, sea anemone, soft coral and other coral reef ecological communities. These organisms are not only an important component of reef biodiversity, but also a hot resource of the latest marine natural products and marine medicine. With diverse bioactive compounds, they have great potentials in the development of new drugs, cosmetics and healthy food.

The South China Sea summer fishing moratorium system, which was officially implemented in China since 1999, has been in effect for 25 years. This system not only demonstrates the Chinese government's commitment to protecting marine fishery resources, but also showcases China as a responsible global leader in safeguarding the marine ecological environment and promoting sustainable fisheries development. However, China's efforts are not always understood. The Philippines and the US have consistently promoted negative narratives targeting China, leveling accusations of environmental destruction in the South China Sea and hinting at possible court action against the country. In February, the Philippines claimed that Chinese fishermen were using cyanide at Huangyan Dao. However, Chinese marine experts have pointed out that the Philippines has, in fact, been using cyanide for fishing since 1962, and approximately 65 tons of cyanide are sprayed onto coral reefs each year, according to World Wildlife Fund. This severely damaged the marine ecology of the South China Sea. Additionally, in 2023, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) issued a report titled \"Environmental Threats to the South China Sea.\" In the report, the Center claims that \"increased fishing, dredging, and land fill, along with giant clam harvesting in recent decades have taken a devastating toll on thousands of species found nowhere else on earth.\" A Chinese researcher dives into the seabed to detect the ecosystem condition around Huangyan Dao.

As the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of destroying coral reefs around Huangyan Dao due to \"illegal actions such as harvesting endangered giant clams\" in May, Chinese experts believe that Manila's move to shift blame to China in an attempt to pursue a new legal battle is doomed to be futile in light of the evidence and facts revealed in the report. From May to June, Chinese scientific researchers carried out an unprecedentedly large-scale on-site investigation to assess the ecological and environmental conditions in the Huangyan Dao area. This included evaluating seawater quality, marine sediment quality, biological quality, floating litter, as well as coral communities, reef-dwelling fish, and other typical biological groups, with the assistance of satellite remote sensing analysis. The results of the research revealed a good seawater and marine sediment quality, which was below-standard levels of pollutants, zero cyanide detected of seawater samples, an abundant distribution of giant clams, and a healthy state of the coral reef ecosystem. Experts noted that this scientific research shows that China's effective governance of Huangyan Dao has played a positive role in protecting the island's ecological environment.

According to the survey results, the bleaching of hard corals in Huangyan Dao remained at a low level (below 1 percent). No coral disease was identified, and the coral mortality rates also remain low (below 1 percent). Since China began to exercise long-term effective administrative jurisdiction over Huangyan Dao, it has gradually repaired the marine pollution and ecological damage caused by previous destructive fishing by the Philippines in the area, Yang Xiao, deputy director of the Institute of Maritime Strategy Studies under the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. He noted that Huangyan Dao used to be a target range for the US military, and the coral reefs there have also been severely damaged by the remnants of shells for a long time. A giant clam discovered in Huangyan Dao area Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment It is worth noting that this survey revealed a rich distribution of giant clams in the lagoon of Huangyan Dao. Giant clams, the largest marine bivalve inhabiting coral reefs, is listed as key protected wildlife in China and is included in the IUCN Red List. The giant clams, as a reef-building organism, contributes to the formation and stabilization of coral reef frameworks, which is essential for the support of coral reef development and the maintenance of a balanced ecosystem Lin told the Global Times that since 2016, China has explicitly banned the sale and purchase of giant clams and their products. This regulation has been strictly enforced, and based on on-site observations, it is no longer possible for illegal digging and harvesting of giant clams to occur on Huangyan Island. The survey also recorded blue coral, fire coral, sea anemone, soft coral and other coral reef ecological communities. These organisms are not only an important component of reef biodiversity, but also a hot resource of the latest marine natural products and marine medicine. With diverse bioactive compounds, they have great potentials in the development of new drugs, cosmetics and healthy food. Coral reefs and abundant fishes in Huangyan Dao area Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment Groundless accusation In recent years, for promoting the scientific conservation and long-term sustainable use of global fishery resources, China has set a model for global marine ecological preservation through innovative measures, including strict annual fishing moratorium policies in its territorial waters. The South China Sea summer fishing moratorium system, which was officially implemented in China since 1999, has been in effect for 25 years. This system not only demonstrates the Chinese government's commitment to protecting marine fishery resources, but also showcases China as a responsible global leader in safeguarding the marine ecological environment and promoting sustainable fisheries development. However, China's efforts are not always understood. The Philippines and the US have consistently promoted negative narratives targeting China, leveling accusations of environmental destruction in the South China Sea and hinting at possible court action against the country. In February, the Philippines claimed that Chinese fishermen were using cyanide at Huangyan Dao. However, Chinese marine experts have pointed out that the Philippines has, in fact, been using cyanide for fishing since 1962, and approximately 65 tons of cyanide are sprayed onto coral reefs each year, according to World Wildlife Fund. This severely damaged the marine ecology of the South China Sea. Additionally, in 2023, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) issued a report titled \"Environmental Threats to the South China Sea.\" In the report, the Center claims that \"increased fishing, dredging, and land fill, along with giant clam harvesting in recent decades have taken a devastating toll on thousands of species found nowhere else on earth.\" A Chinese researcher dives into the seabed to detect the ecosystem condition around Huangyan Dao. Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment According to scholars who are directly engaged in ecological surveys and research in the South China Sea, many conclusions in this report are based on little to no scientific proof. \"Only on-site scientific investigations with facts are worthy of respect. This scientific report provides a strong rebuttal to the Philippines' proposed environmental arbitration against China. In the face of facts, the Philippines' futile attempts are doomed to fail,\" said Yang.", "The aerial view of China's Huangyan Dao Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment China on Wednesday released the first investigative and assessment report on the ecological environment near Huangyan Dao (also known as Huangyan Island) in South China Sea, revealing that the area enjoys excellent eco-environmental quality. As the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of destroying coral reefs around Huangyan Dao due to \"illegal actions such as harvesting endangered giant clams\" in May, Chinese experts believe that Manila's move to shift blame to China in an attempt to pursue a new legal battle is doomed to be futile in light of the evidence and facts revealed in the report. From May to June, Chinese scientific researchers carried out an unprecedentedly large-scale on-site investigation to assess the ecological and environmental conditions in the Huangyan Dao area. This included evaluating seawater quality, marine sediment quality, biological quality, floating litter, as well as coral communities, reef-dwelling fish, and other typical biological groups, with the assistance of satellite remote sensing analysis. The results of the research revealed a good seawater and marine sediment quality, which was below-standard levels of pollutants, zero cyanide detected of seawater samples, an abundant distribution of giant clams, and a healthy state of the coral reef ecosystem. Experts noted that this scientific research shows that China's effective governance of Huangyan Dao has played a positive role in protecting the island's ecological environment. The scientific research ship in China's Huangyan Dao area Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment A harbor of corals Huangyan Dao located in the southeast of Zhongsha Qundao, serving as a key traditional fishing area and natural shelter in China. It is also a vital \"harbor\" for maintaining marine biodiversity in the South China Sea, holding substantial strategic and ecological significance. Since last year, some Philippine politicians and media have repeatedly hyped up the topic of falsely claiming that Chinese fishermen used cyanide to fish in waters off Huangyan Dao and deliberately destroyed the traditional fishing grounds of Philippine fishermen. However, according to the report, no cyanide, copper, lead, cadmium, total chromium, mercury, or arsenic were detected at any survey sites. In response to Global Times' question on whether it means there was no cyanide fishing in the area, Lin Kui, the deputy director of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment, confirmed the conclusion. During the more than 20 days of scientific research, the joint investigation team did not find fishermen illegally using cyanide for fishing, Lin stressed. He also cited published academic paper that Filipino fishermen have used cyanide to poison fish since 1930s, and even during the global pandemic years, there were still reports of Filipino fishermen using cyanide to poison fish at sea. \"We sincerely hope that countries around the South China Sea can stop using cyanide for fishing and other destructive fishing activities, and work together to protect the fragile ecosystem of the South China Sea,\" Lin said. Live coral reefs in the lagoon of Huangyan Dao Photo: Courtesy of South China Institute of Environmental Sciences under China Ministry of Ecology and Environment Results also show that it meets the water quality requirements for coral growth in the South China Sea. There are also no signs of seawater eutrophication. The hard coral communities were in healthy condition, while live coral cover in the northeast part of Huangyan Dao reached as high as 37.1 percent. This is comparable to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia that contains the world's largest collection of coral reefs, the report showed. The scientific research recorded 109 species of hard corals belonging to 34 genera and 12 families, marking the highest species diversity ever documented. The average hard coral cover reached 28.6 percent, higher than the survey results in 2015, with sufficient recruitment of juvenile corals. All the hard coral species were listed as national Class II protected wildlife in China. Among the hard corals in this survey, 41 species were classified as Near Threatened and 14 species as Vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List). The species diversity of coral communities was relatively high, as the survey recorded 125 species of coral reef fish from 23 families on-site.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced this while meeting in Beijing. Experts described Hasina's visit to China as a journey of cooperation and friendship. Although some Indian media outlets are seemingly concerned about the visit, experts said the development of China-Bangladesh ties does not target any third party, and will be conducive to overall peace and stability in South Asia. During Wednesday's meeting, Xi told Hasina that China and Bangladesh are good neighbors who know each other well and have had friendly exchanges for thousands of years. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have always respected and supported each other, treated each other as equals, and cooperated for win-win results, setting an example of friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries, especially between the \"Global South.\" China cherishes the profound friendship established by the older generation of leaders of China and Bangladesh, and is willing to take the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year as an opportunity to deepen the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and expand the depth and breadth of cooperation in various fields, the Chinese President said. Xi stressed that China supports Bangladesh in adhering to an independent foreign policy, following a development path that suits its national conditions, safeguarding national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and opposing any external interference. Hasina said that Bangladesh firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports China's stance on the Taiwan question, resolutely opposes external forces' interference in China's internal affairs, and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core interests. Earlier on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also met with Hasina. According to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the country's national news agency, the two countries have signed 21 instruments including two renewed MoUs and announced seven more projects. Talks between Li and Hasina mainly concerned trade and investment, as well as bilateral relations alongside various regional and international matters, according to BSS. The instruments on cooperation in the economic and banking sector, trade and investment, digital economy, infrastructure development, assistance in disaster management, construction of 6th and 9th Bangladesh-China friendship bridges, export of agricultural products from Bangladesh and people to people connectivity were signed. Closer economic, trade ties While in Beijing, Hasina attended the \"Bangladesh-China Business, Trade and Investment Summit\" on Tuesday and delivered a keynote speech. Hasina said she \"encouraged the Chinese business community to consider key sectors in Bangladesh, such as energy, renewable energy and logistic centers,\" adding that Bangladesh is also \"keen to export more products to China, such as textiles, garments, leather and leather goods and other products,\" according to CGTN. At the event, industry giants Huawei and China National Chemical Engineering Group Corporation signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with delegates from Bangladesh. Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, said the visit by Hasina is a link between the past and the future for bilateral relations, especially in promoting high-level cooperation in the field of economy and trade. The development strategies of the two countries will be further synergized, and more economic and trade cooperation projects are expected to be implemented in the future, injecting more substantive connotations into the duo's strategic cooperative relations, Qian said. In the latest trade data released by China's General Administration of Customs, from January to May , China-Bangladesh bilateral trade amounted to 74.91 billion yuan ($10.30 billion), gaining a positive growth of 0.2 percent year-on-year. China remains Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Moreover, China has also been one of the largest sources of investment in the South Asian country. As of the end of 2023, China's investment stock in Bangladesh had increased to nearly $1.4 billion, and there were nearly 700 Chinese-funded companies in Bangladesh, creating more than 550,000 jobs, according to the Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh. Hasina's visit to China will further promote the traditional friendship between the two countries, said Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow with the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Through cooperation over the past years, Bangladesh has clearly seen how China's development ideas and experience have played a huge role in promoting the economic and social development of Bangladesh, Hu said. \"Specifically, the economic and technical assistance of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh's infrastructure construction, China's assistance in training local medical and health professionals in Bangladesh, and the increase in the scale of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,\" Hu added. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries is an illustration for more South Asian countries to understand China's concept of good-neighborly friendship, the idea of sharing the fruits of development, and the image of China as a responsible major power, Qian said. Balance and opportunity Hasina also talked with China's top political advisor Wang Huning on Tuesday. Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, China and Bangladesh respect and treat each other with equality, setting a good example of friendly coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries. But some Indian media outlets viewed Hasina's China visit as \"a balancing act to keep the two key players happy,\" as \"she needs India to be in power, and China for economic support.\" Some Indian media also talked down the cooperation between Beijing and Dhaka. Hasina's visit to Beijing took place shortly after her visit to New Delhi, which tends to view some other South Asian countries including Bangladesh as its sphere of influence. Hasina made a two-day visit to India from June 21 to 22, during which the two sides signed agreements to expand cooperation in maritime security, the ocean economy, space and telecommunication sectors. Before Hasina's visit to China, Bangladesh's ruling Awami League general secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said on July 6 that \"India is a political friend of Bangladesh and China is a development partner,\" explaining the country's relationship with two major powers. Some analysts said that with the intensifying geopolitical game, some South Asian countries such as Bangladesh are facing a tough situation: If they want to achieve rapid economic and social development, they need to cooperate with China. However, close economic cooperation with China will inevitably draw political and security pressure from countries such as India and the US. India always uses various excuses to obstruct and create hype whenever a South Asian leader visits China, but New Delhi should not be overly concerned that other countries' engagement with China will damage their relations with India, Hu said. The development of bilateral relations between China and Bangladesh promoted by Hasina's visit will be conducive to the overall peace and stability in South Asia, Hu said. The development of China-Bangladesh relations does not target any third party, said Qian, noting that China always opposes zero-sum game and stands for mutually beneficial cooperation. Against the backdrop of complex geopolitics, China respects Bangladesh's strategic choice and has no objection to Bangladesh developing friendly and cooperative relations with other countries, Qian said. For Bangladesh, in the face of pressure from India, the development of China-Bangladesh relations also provides a valuable choice for Dhaka to better safeguard its diplomatic independence and development opportunities, Qian said.", "Closer economic, trade ties", "Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the People's Republic of Bangladesh at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 10, 2024.

According to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the country's national news agency, the two countries have signed 21 instruments including two renewed MoUs and announced seven more projects. Talks between Li and Hasina mainly concerned trade and investment, as well as bilateral relations alongside various regional and international matters, according to BSS. The instruments on cooperation in the economic and banking sector, trade and investment, digital economy, infrastructure development, assistance in disaster management, construction of 6th and 9th Bangladesh-China friendship bridges, export of agricultural products from Bangladesh and people to people connectivity were signed. Closer economic, trade ties While in Beijing, Hasina attended the \"Bangladesh-China Business, Trade and Investment Summit\" on Tuesday and delivered a keynote speech. Hasina said she \"encouraged the Chinese business community to consider key sectors in Bangladesh, such as energy, renewable energy and logistic centers,\" adding that Bangladesh is also \"keen to export more products to China, such as textiles, garments, leather and leather goods and other products,\" according to CGTN. At the event, industry giants Huawei and China National Chemical Engineering Group Corporation signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with delegates from Bangladesh. Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, said the visit by Hasina is a link between the past and the future for bilateral relations, especially in promoting high-level cooperation in the field of economy and trade. The development strategies of the two countries will be further synergized, and more economic and trade cooperation projects are expected to be implemented in the future, injecting more substantive connotations into the duo's strategic cooperative relations, Qian said. In the latest trade data released by China's General Administration of Customs, from January to May , China-Bangladesh bilateral trade amounted to 74.91 billion yuan ($10.30 billion), gaining a positive growth of 0.2 percent year-on-year. China remains Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Moreover, China has also been one of the largest sources of investment in the South Asian country. As of the end of 2023, China's investment stock in Bangladesh had increased to nearly $1.4 billion, and there were nearly 700 Chinese-funded companies in Bangladesh, creating more than 550,000 jobs, according to the Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh. Hasina's visit to China will further promote the traditional friendship between the two countries, said Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow with the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Through cooperation over the past years, Bangladesh has clearly seen how China's development ideas and experience have played a huge role in promoting the economic and social development of Bangladesh, Hu said. \"Specifically, the economic and technical assistance of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh's infrastructure construction, China's assistance in training local medical and health professionals in Bangladesh, and the increase in the scale of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,\" Hu added. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries is an illustration for more South Asian countries to understand China's concept of good-neighborly friendship, the idea of sharing the fruits of development, and the image of China as a responsible major power, Qian said. Balance and opportunity Hasina also talked with China's top political advisor Wang Huning on Tuesday. Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, China and Bangladesh respect and treat each other with equality, setting a good example of friendly coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries. But some Indian media outlets viewed Hasina's China visit as \"a balancing act to keep the two key players happy,\" as \"she needs India to be in power, and China for economic support.\" Some Indian media also talked down the cooperation between Beijing and Dhaka. Hasina's visit to Beijing took place shortly after her visit to New Delhi, which tends to view some other South Asian countries including Bangladesh as its sphere of influence. Hasina made a two-day visit to India from June 21 to 22, during which the two sides signed agreements to expand cooperation in maritime security, the ocean economy, space and telecommunication sectors. Before Hasina's visit to China, Bangladesh's ruling Awami League general secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said on July 6 that \"India is a political friend of Bangladesh and China is a development partner,\" explaining the country's relationship with two major powers. Some analysts said that with the intensifying geopolitical game, some South Asian countries such as Bangladesh are facing a tough situation: If they want to achieve rapid economic and social development, they need to cooperate with China. However, close economic cooperation with China will inevitably draw political and security pressure from countries such as India and the US. India always uses various excuses to obstruct and create hype whenever a South Asian leader visits China, but New Delhi should not be overly concerned that other countries' engagement with China will damage their relations with India, Hu said. The development of bilateral relations between China and Bangladesh promoted by Hasina's visit will be conducive to the overall peace and stability in South Asia, Hu said. The development of China-Bangladesh relations does not target any third party, said Qian, noting that China always opposes zero-sum game and stands for mutually beneficial cooperation. Against the backdrop of complex geopolitics, China respects Bangladesh's strategic choice and has no objection to Bangladesh developing friendly and cooperative relations with other countries, Qian said. For Bangladesh, in the face of pressure from India, the development of China-Bangladesh relations also provides a valuable choice for Dhaka to better safeguard its diplomatic independence and development opportunities, Qian said.", "Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the People's Republic of Bangladesh at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 10, 2024.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have always respected and supported each other, treated each other as equals, and cooperated for win-win results, setting an example of friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries, especially between the \"Global South.\" China cherishes the profound friendship established by the older generation of leaders of China and Bangladesh, and is willing to take the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year as an opportunity to deepen the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and expand the depth and breadth of cooperation in various fields, the Chinese President said. Xi stressed that China supports Bangladesh in adhering to an independent foreign policy, following a development path that suits its national conditions, safeguarding national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and opposing any external interference. Hasina said that Bangladesh firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports China's stance on the Taiwan question, resolutely opposes external forces' interference in China's internal affairs, and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core interests. Earlier on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also met with Hasina. According to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the country's national news agency, the two countries have signed 21 instruments including two renewed MoUs and announced seven more projects. Talks between Li and Hasina mainly concerned trade and investment, as well as bilateral relations alongside various regional and international matters, according to BSS. The instruments on cooperation in the economic and banking sector, trade and investment, digital economy, infrastructure development, assistance in disaster management, construction of 6th and 9th Bangladesh-China friendship bridges, export of agricultural products from Bangladesh and people to people connectivity were signed. Closer economic, trade ties While in Beijing, Hasina attended the \"Bangladesh-China Business, Trade and Investment Summit\" on Tuesday and delivered a keynote speech. Hasina said she \"encouraged the Chinese business community to consider key sectors in Bangladesh, such as energy, renewable energy and logistic centers,\" adding that Bangladesh is also \"keen to export more products to China, such as textiles, garments, leather and leather goods and other products,\" according to CGTN. At the event, industry giants Huawei and China National Chemical Engineering Group Corporation signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with delegates from Bangladesh. Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, said the visit by Hasina is a link between the past and the future for bilateral relations, especially in promoting high-level cooperation in the field of economy and trade. The development strategies of the two countries will be further synergized, and more economic and trade cooperation projects are expected to be implemented in the future, injecting more substantive connotations into the duo's strategic cooperative relations, Qian said. In the latest trade data released by China's General Administration of Customs, from January to May , China-Bangladesh bilateral trade amounted to 74.91 billion yuan ($10.30 billion), gaining a positive growth of 0.2 percent year-on-year. China remains Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Moreover, China has also been one of the largest sources of investment in the South Asian country. As of the end of 2023, China's investment stock in Bangladesh had increased to nearly $1.4 billion, and there were nearly 700 Chinese-funded companies in Bangladesh, creating more than 550,000 jobs, according to the Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh. Hasina's visit to China will further promote the traditional friendship between the two countries, said Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow with the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Through cooperation over the past years, Bangladesh has clearly seen how China's development ideas and experience have played a huge role in promoting the economic and social development of Bangladesh, Hu said. \"Specifically, the economic and technical assistance of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh's infrastructure construction, China's assistance in training local medical and health professionals in Bangladesh, and the increase in the scale of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,\" Hu added. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries is an illustration for more South Asian countries to understand China's concept of good-neighborly friendship, the idea of sharing the fruits of development, and the image of China as a responsible major power, Qian said. Balance and opportunity Hasina also talked with China's top political advisor Wang Huning on Tuesday. Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, China and Bangladesh respect and treat each other with equality, setting a good example of friendly coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries. But some Indian media outlets viewed Hasina's China visit as \"a balancing act to keep the two key players happy,\" as \"she needs India to be in power, and China for economic support.\" Some Indian media also talked down the cooperation between Beijing and Dhaka. Hasina's visit to Beijing took place shortly after her visit to New Delhi, which tends to view some other South Asian countries including Bangladesh as its sphere of influence. Hasina made a two-day visit to India from June 21 to 22, during which the two sides signed agreements to expand cooperation in maritime security, the ocean economy, space and telecommunication sectors. Before Hasina's visit to China, Bangladesh's ruling Awami League general secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said on July 6 that \"India is a political friend of Bangladesh and China is a development partner,\" explaining the country's relationship with two major powers. Some analysts said that with the intensifying geopolitical game, some South Asian countries such as Bangladesh are facing a tough situation: If they want to achieve rapid economic and social development, they need to cooperate with China. However, close economic cooperation with China will inevitably draw political and security pressure from countries such as India and the US. India always uses various excuses to obstruct and create hype whenever a South Asian leader visits China, but New Delhi should not be overly concerned that other countries' engagement with China will damage their relations with India, Hu said. The development of bilateral relations between China and Bangladesh promoted by Hasina's visit will be conducive to the overall peace and stability in South Asia, Hu said. The development of China-Bangladesh relations does not target any third party, said Qian, noting that China always opposes zero-sum game and stands for mutually beneficial cooperation. Against the backdrop of complex geopolitics, China respects Bangladesh's strategic choice and has no objection to Bangladesh developing friendly and cooperative relations with other countries, Qian said. For Bangladesh, in the face of pressure from India, the development of China-Bangladesh relations also provides a valuable choice for Dhaka to better safeguard its diplomatic independence and development opportunities, Qian said."], "trend": [], "report": ["Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences."], "industry": ["Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the People's Republic of Bangladesh at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 10, 2024.
